   Note: Certain anniversaries of an unbroken marriage have
         received fanciful, and more or less appropriate, names.
         Thus, the fifth anniversary is called the wooden
         wedding; the tenth, the tin wedding; the fifteenth, the
         crystal wedding; the twentieth, the china wedding; the
         twenty-fifth, the silver wedding; the fiftieth, the
         golden wedding; the sixtieth, the diamond wedding.
         These anniversaries are often celebrated by appropriate
         presents of wood, tin, china, silver, gold, etc., given
         by friends.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: Wedding is often used adjectively; as, wedding cake,
         wedding cards, wedding clothes, wedding day, wedding
         feast, wedding guest, wedding ring, etc.
         [1913 Webster]

               Let her beauty be her wedding dower. --Shak.
