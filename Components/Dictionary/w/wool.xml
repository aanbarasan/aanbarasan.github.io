      <WordDefinition>Wool
   one of the first material used for making woven cloth (Lev.
   13:47, 48, 52, 59; 19:19). The first-fruit of wool was to be
   offered to the priests (Deut. 18:4). The law prohibiting the
   wearing of a garment "of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen
   together" (Deut. 22:11) may, like some other laws of a similar
   character, have been intended to express symbolically the
   separateness and simplicity of God's covenant people. The wool
   of Damascus, famous for its whiteness, was of great repute in
   the Tyrian market (Ezek. 27:18).
