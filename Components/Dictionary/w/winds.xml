      <WordDefinition>Winds
   blowing from the four quarters of heaven (Jer. 49:36; Ezek.
   37:9; Dan. 8:8; Zech. 2:6). The east wind was parching (Ezek.
   17:10; 19:12), and is sometimes mentioned as simply denoting a
   strong wind (Job 27:21; Isa. 27:8). This wind prevails in
   Palestine from February to June, as the west wind (Luke 12:54)
   does from November to February. The south was a hot wind (Job
   37:17; Luke 12:55). It swept over the Arabian peninsula. The
   rush of invaders is figuratively spoken of as a whirlwind (Isa.
   21:1); a commotion among the nations of the world as a striving
   of the four winds (Dan. 7:2). The winds are subject to the
   divine power (Ps. 18:10; 135:7).
