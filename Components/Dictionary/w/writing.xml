      <WordDefinition>Writing
   The art of writing must have been known in the time of the early
   Pharaohs. Moses is commanded "to write for a memorial in a book"
   (Ex. 17:14) a record of the attack of Amalek. Frequent mention
   is afterwards made of writing (28:11, 21, 29, 36; 31:18; 32:15,
   16; 34:1, 28; 39:6, 14, 30). The origin of this art is unknown,
   but there is reason to conclude that in the age of Moses it was
   well known. The inspired books of Moses are the most ancient
   extant writings, although there are written monuments as old as
   about B.C. 2000. The words expressive of "writing," "book," and
   "ink," are common to all the branches or dialects of the Semitic
   language, and hence it has been concluded that this art must
   have been known to the earliest Semites before they separated
   into their various tribes, and nations, and families.
   
     "The Old Testament and the discoveries of Oriental archaeology
   alike tell us that the age of the Exodus was throughout the
   world of Western Asia an age of literature and books, of readers
   and writers, and that the cities of Palestine were stored with
   the contemporaneous records of past events inscribed on
   imperishable clay. They further tell us that the kinsfolk and
   neighbours of the Israelites were already acquainted with
   alphabetic writing, that the wanderers in the desert and the
   tribes of Edom were in contact with the cultured scribes and
   traders of Ma'in [Southern Arabia], and that the 'house of
   bondage' from which Israel had escaped was a land where the art
   of writing was blazoned not only on the temples of the gods, but
   also on the dwellings of the rich and powerful.", Sayce. (See
   {DEBIR}; {PHOENICIA}.)
   
     The "Book of the Dead" was a collection of prayers and
   formulae, by the use of which the souls of the dead were
   supposed to attain to rest and peace in the next world. It was
   composed at various periods from the earliest time to the
   Persian conquest. It affords an interesting glimpse into the
   religious life and system of belief among the ancient Egyptians.
   We learn from it that they believed in the existence of one
   Supreme Being, the immortality of the soul, judgement after
   death, and the resurrection of the body. It shows, too, a high
   state of literary activity in Egypt in the time of Moses. It
   refers to extensive libraries then existing. That of Ramessium,
   in Thebes, e.g., built by Rameses II., contained 20,000 books.
   
     When the Hebrews entered Canaan it is evident that the art of
   writing was known to the original inhabitants, as appears, e.g.,
   from the name of the city Debir having been at first
   Kirjath-sepher, i.e., the "city of the book," or the "book town"
   (Josh. 10:38; 15:15; Judg. 1:11).
   
     The first mention of letter-writing is in the time of David (2
   Sam. 11:14, 15). Letters are afterwards frequently spoken of (1
   Kings 21:8, 9, 11; 2 Kings 10:1, 3, 6, 7; 19:14; 2 Chr.
   21:12-15; 30:1, 6-9, etc.).
