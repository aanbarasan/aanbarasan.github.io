      <WordDefinition>Will \Will\, n. [OE. wille, AS. willa; akin to OFries. willa,
   OS. willeo, willio, D. wil, G. wille, Icel. vili, Dan.
   villie, Sw. vilja, Goth wilja. See {Will}, v.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. The power of choosing; the faculty or endowment of the
      soul by which it is capable of choosing; the faculty or
      power of the mind by which we decide to do or not to do;
      the power or faculty of preferring or selecting one of two
      or more objects.
      [1913 Webster]

            It is necessary to form a distinct notion of what is
            meant by the word ``volition'' in order to
            understand the import of the word will, for this
            last word expresses the power of mind of which
            ``volition'' is the act.              --Stewart.
      [1913 Webster]

            Will is an ambiguous word, being sometimes put for
            the faculty of willing; sometimes for the act of
            that faculty, besides [having] other meanings. But
            ``volition'' always signifies the act of willing,
            and nothing else.                     --Reid.
      [1913 Webster]

            Appetite is the will's solicitor, and the will is
            appetite's controller; what we covet according to
            the one, by the other we often reject. --Hooker.
      [1913 Webster]

            The will is plainly that by which the mind chooses
            anything.                             --J. Edwards.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. The choice which is made; a determination or preference
      which results from the act or exercise of the power of
      choice; a volition.
      [1913 Webster]

            The word ``will,'' however, is not always used in
            this its proper acceptation, but is frequently
            substituted for ``volition'', as when I say that my
            hand mover in obedience to my will.   --Stewart.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. The choice or determination of one who has authority; a
      decree; a command; discretionary pleasure.
      [1913 Webster]

            Thy will be done.                     --Matt. vi.
                                                  10.
      [1913 Webster]

            Our prayers should be according to the will of God.
                                                  --Law.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. Strong wish or inclination; desire; purpose.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: ``Inclination is another word with which will is
         frequently confounded. Thus, when the apothecary says,
         in Romeo and Juliet, 
         [1913 Webster]

               My poverty, but not my will, consents; . . .
               Put this in any liquid thing you will,
               And drink it off.
         [1913 Webster] the word will is plainly used as,
         synonymous with inclination; not in the strict logical
         sense, as the immediate antecedent of action. It is
         with the same latitude that the word is used in common
         conversation, when we speak of doing a thing which duty
         prescribes, against one's own will; or when we speak of
         doing a thing willingly or unwillingly.'' --Stewart.
         [1913 Webster]

   5. That which is strongly wished or desired.
      [1913 Webster]

            What's your will, good friar?         --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            The mariner hath his will.            --Coleridge.
      [1913 Webster]

   6. Arbitrary disposal; power to control, dispose, or
      determine.
      [1913 Webster]

            Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies.
                                                  --Ps. xxvii.
                                                  12.
      [1913 Webster]

   7. (Law) The legal declaration of a person's mind as to the
      manner in which he would have his property or estate
      disposed of after his death; the written instrument,
      legally executed, by which a man makes disposition of his
      estate, to take effect after his death; testament; devise.
      See the Note under {Testament}, 1.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Wills are written or nuncupative, that is, oral. See
         {Nuncupative will}, under {Nuncupative}.
         [1913 Webster]

   {At will} (Law), at pleasure. To hold an estate at the will
      of another, is to enjoy the possession at his pleasure,
      and be liable to be ousted at any time by the lessor or
      proprietor. An estate at will is at the will of both
      parties.

   {Good will}. See under {Good}.

   {Ill will}, enmity; unfriendliness; malevolence.

   {To have one's will}, to obtain what is desired; to do what
      one pleases.

   {Will worship}, worship according to the dictates of the will
      or fancy; formal worship. [Obs.]

   {Will worshiper}, one who offers will worship. [Obs.] --Jer.
      Taylor.

   {With a will}, with willingness and zeal; with all one's
      heart or strength; earnestly; heartily.

      <WordDefinition>Will \Will\, v. t. &amp; auxiliary. [imp. {Would}. Indic. present, I
   will (Obs. I wol), thou wilt, he will (Obs. he wol); we, ye,
   they will.] [OE. willen, imp. wolde; akin to OS. willan,
   OFries. willa, D. willen, G. wollen, OHG. wollan, wellan,
   Icel. &amp; Sw. vilja, Dan. ville, Goth. wiljan, OSlav. voliti,
   L. velle to wish, volo I wish; cf. Skr. v[.r] to choose, to
   prefer. Cf. {Voluntary}, {Welcome}, {Well}, adv.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. To wish; to desire; to incline to have.
      [1913 Webster]

            A wife as of herself no thing ne sholde [should]
            Wille in effect, but as her husband wolde [would].
                                                  --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

            Caleb said unto her, What will thou ? --Judg. i. 14.
      [1913 Webster]

            They would none of my counsel.        --Prov. i. 30.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. As an auxiliary, will is used to denote futurity dependent
      on the verb. Thus, in first person, ``I will'' denotes
      willingness, consent, promise; and when ``will'' is
      emphasized, it denotes determination or fixed purpose; as,
      I will go if you wish; I will go at all hazards. In the
      second and third persons, the idea of distinct volition,
      wish, or purpose is evanescent, and simple certainty is
      appropriately expressed; as, ``You will go,'' or ``He will
      go,'' describes a future event as a fact only. To
      emphasize will denotes (according to the tone or context)
      certain futurity or fixed determination.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Will, auxiliary, may be used elliptically for will go.
         ``I'll to her lodgings.'' --Marlowe.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: As in shall (which see), the second and third persons
         may be virtually converted into the first, either by
         question or indirect statement, so as to receive the
         meaning which belongs to will in that person; thus,
         ``Will you go?'' (answer, ``I will go'') asks assent,
         requests, etc.; while ``Will he go?'' simply inquires
         concerning futurity; thus, also,``He says or thinks he
         will go,'' ``You say or think you will go,'' both
         signify willingness or consent.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: Would, as the preterit of will, is chiefly employed in
         conditional, subjunctive, or optative senses; as, he
         would go if he could; he could go if he would; he said
         that he would go; I would fain go, but can not; I would
         that I were young again; and other like phrases. In the
         last use, the first personal pronoun is often omitted;
         as, would that he were here; would to Heaven that it
         were so; and, omitting the to in such an adjuration.
         ``Would God I had died for thee.'' Would is used for
         both present and future time, in conditional
         propositions, and would have for past time; as, he
         would go now if he were ready; if it should rain, he
         would not go; he would have gone, had he been able.
         Would not, as also will not, signifies refusal. ``He
         was angry, and would not go in.'' --Luke xv. 28. Would
         is never a past participle.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: In Ireland, Scotland, and the United States, especially
         in the southern and western portions of the United
         States, shall and will, should and would, are often
         misused, as in the following examples: 
         [1913 Webster]

               I am able to devote as much time and attention to
               other subjects as I will [shall] be under the
               necessity of doing next winter.    --Chalmers.
         [1913 Webster]

               A countryman, telling us what he had seen,
               remarked that if the conflagration went on, as it
               was doing, we would [should] have, as our next
               season's employment, the Old Town of Edinburgh to
               rebuild.                           --H. Miller.
         [1913 Webster]

               I feel assured that I will [shall] not have the
               misfortune to find conflicting views held by one
               so enlightened as your excellency. --J. Y. Mason.

      <WordDefinition>Will \Will\, v. i.
   To be willing; to be inclined or disposed; to be pleased; to
   wish; to desire.
   [1913 Webster]

         And behold, there came a leper and worshiped him,
         saying, Lord if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
         And Jesus . . . touched him, saying, I will; be thou
         clean.                                   --Matt. viii.
                                                  2, 3.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: This word has been confused with will, v. i., to
         choose, which, unlike this, is of the weak conjugation.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Will I, nill I}, or {Will ye, hill ye}, or {Will he, nill
   he}, whether I, you, or he will it or not; hence, without
      choice; compulsorily; -- commonly abbreviated to {willy
      nilly}. ``If I must take service willy nilly.'' --J. H.
      Newman. ``Land for all who would till it, and reading and
      writing will ye, nill ye.'' --Lowell.
