      <WordDefinition>Wandering
   of the Israelites in the wilderness in consequence of their
   rebellious fears to enter the Promised Land (Num. 14:26-35).
   They wandered for forty years before they were permitted to
   cross the Jordan (Josh. 4:19; 5:6).
   
     The record of these wanderings is given in Num. 33:1-49. Many
   of the stations at which they camped cannot now be identified.
   
     Questions of an intricate nature have been discussed regarding
   the "Wanderings," but it is enough for us to take the sacred
   narrative as it stands, and rest assured that "He led them forth
   by the right way" (Ps. 107:1-7, 33-35). (See {WILDERNESS}.)
