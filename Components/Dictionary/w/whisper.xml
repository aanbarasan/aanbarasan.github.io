   [1913 Webster]
   1. A low, soft, sibilant voice or utterance, which can be
      heard only by those near at hand; voice or utterance that

      taking the place of the vibration of the cords that
      produces tone; sometimes, in a limited sense, the sound
      produced by such friction as distinguished from breath
      sound made by friction against parts of the mouth. See
      {Voice}, n., 2, and Guide to Pronunciation, [sect][sect]
