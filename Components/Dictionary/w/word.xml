      <WordDefinition>word
     
        &lt;storage&gt; A fundamental unit of storage in a computer.  The
        size of a word in a particular computer architecture is one of
        its chief distinguishing characteristics.
     
        The size of a word is usually the same as the width of the
        computer's {data bus} so it is possible to read or write a
        word in a single operation.  An instruction is usually one or
        more words long and a word can be used to hold a whole number
        of characters.  These days, this nearly always means a whole
        number of {bytes} (eight bits), most often 32 or 64 bits.  In
        the past when six bit {character sets} were used, a word might
        be a multiple of six bits, e.g. 24 bits (four characters) in
        the {ICL 1900} series.
