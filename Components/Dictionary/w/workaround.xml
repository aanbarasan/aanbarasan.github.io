        Customers often find themselves living with workarounds for
        long periods of time rather than getting a {bug fix}.

      <WordDefinition>workaround n. 1. A temporary {kluge} used to bypass, mask, or otherwise
   avoid a {bug} or {misfeature} in some system. Theoretically, workarounds
   are always replaced by {fix}es; in practice, customers often find
   themselves living with workarounds for long periods of time. "The code
   died on NUL characters in the input, so I fixed it to interpret them as
   spaces." "That's not a fix, that's a workaround!" 2. A procedure to be
   employed by the user in order to do what some currently non-working
   feature should do. Hypothetical example: "Using META-F7 {crash}es the
   4.43 build of Weemax, but as a workaround you can type CTRL-R, then
   SHIFT-F5, and delete the remaining {cruft} by hand."
