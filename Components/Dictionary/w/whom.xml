   1. Originally, an interrogative pronoun, later, a relative
      pronoun also; -- used always substantively, and either as
      singular or plural. See the Note under {What}, pron., 1.
      As interrogative pronouns, who and whom ask the question:
      What or which person or persons? Who and whom, as relative
      pronouns (in the sense of that), are properly used of
      persons (corresponding to which, as applied to things),
      but are sometimes, less properly and now rarely, used of
      animals, plants, etc. Who and whom, as compound relatives,
      are also used especially of persons, meaning the person
      that; the persons that; the one that; whosoever. ``Let who
      will be President.'' --Macaulay.
