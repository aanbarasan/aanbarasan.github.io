      <WordDefinition>WOMAN, n.

        An animal usually living in the vicinity of Man, and having a
    rudimentary susceptibility to domestication.  It is credited by
    many of the elder zoologists with a certain vestigial docility
    acquired in a former state of seclusion, but naturalists of the
    postsusananthony period, having no knowledge of the seclusion,
    deny the virtue and declare that such as creation's dawn beheld,
    it roareth now.  The species is the most widely distributed of all
    beasts of prey, infesting all habitable parts of the globe, from
    Greeland's spicy mountains to India's moral strand.  The popular
    name (wolfman) is incorrect, for the creature is of the cat kind. 
    The woman is lithe and graceful in its movement, especially the
    American variety (_felis pugnans_), is omnivorous and can be
    taught not to talk.
                                                       Balthasar Pober

      <WordDefinition>Woman
   was "taken out of man" (Gen. 2:23), and therefore the man has
   the preeminence. "The head of the woman is the man;" but yet
   honour is to be shown to the wife, "as unto the weaker vessel"
   (1 Cor. 11:3, 8, 9; 1 Pet. 3:7). Several women are mentioned in
   Scripture as having been endowed with prophetic gifts, as Miriam
   (Ex. 15:20), Deborah (Judg. 4:4, 5), Huldah (2 Kings 22:14),
   Noadiah (Neh. 6:14), Anna (Luke 2:36, 37), and the daughters of
   Philip the evangelist (Acts 21:8, 9). Women are forbidden to
   teach publicly (1 Cor. 14:34, 35; 1 Tim. 2:11, 12). Among the
   Hebrews it devolved upon women to prepare the meals for the
   household (Gen. 18:6; 2 Sam. 13:8), to attend to the work of
   spinning (Ex. 35:26; Prov. 31:19), and making clothes (1 Sam.
   2:19; Prov. 31:21), to bring water from the well (Gen. 24:15; 1
   Sam. 9:11), and to care for the flocks (Gen. 29:6; Ex. 2:16).
   
     The word "woman," as used in Matt. 15:28, John 2:4 and 20:13,
   15, implies tenderness and courtesy and not disrespect. Only
   where revelation is known has woman her due place of honour
   assigned to her.
