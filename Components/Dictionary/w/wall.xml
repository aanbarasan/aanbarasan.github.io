      <WordDefinition>WALL :STREET:, n.  A symbol for sin for every devil to rebuke.  That
Wall Street is a den of thieves is a belief that serves every
unsuccessful thief in place of a hope in Heaven.  Even the great and
good Andrew Carnegie has made his profession of faith in the matter.

    Carnegie the dauntless has uttered his call
    To battle:  "The brokers are parasites all!"
    Carnegie, Carnegie, you'll never prevail;
    Keep the wind of your slogan to belly your sail,
    Go back to your isle of perpetual brume,
    Silence your pibroch, doff tartan and plume:
    Ben Lomond is calling his son from the fray --
    Fly, fly from the region of Wall Street away!
    While still you're possessed of a single baubee
    (I wish it were pledged to endowment of me)
    'Twere wise to retreat from the wars of finance
    Lest its value decline ere your credit advance.
    For a man 'twixt a king of finance and the sea,
    Carnegie, Carnegie, your tongue is too free!
                                                         Anonymus Bink

      <WordDefinition>Wall
   Cities were surrounded by walls, as distinguished from "unwalled
   villages" (Ezek. 38:11; Lev. 25:29-34). They were made thick and
   strong (Num. 13:28; Deut. 3:5). Among the Jews walls were built
   of stone, some of those in the temple being of great size (1
   Kings 6:7; 7:9-12; 20:30; Mark 13:1, 2). The term is used
   metaphorically of security and safety (Isa. 26:1; 60:18; Rev.
   21:12-20). (See {FENCE}.)

      <WordDefinition>wall interj. [WPI] 1. An indication of confusion, usually spoken with a
   quizzical tone: "Wall??" 2. A request for further explication. Compare
   {octal forty}. 3. [Unix, from `write all'] v. To send a message to
   everyone currently logged in, esp. with the wall(8) utility.

   It is said that sense 1 came from the idiom `like talking to a blank
   wall'. It was originally used in situations where, after you had
   carefully answered a question, the questioner stared at you blankly,
   clearly having understood nothing that was explained. You would then
   throw out a "Hello, wall?" to elicit some sort of response from the
   questioner. Later, confused questioners began voicing "Wall?"
   themselves.
