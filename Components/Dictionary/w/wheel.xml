      <WordDefinition>Wheel
   (Heb. galgal; rendered "wheel" in Ps. 83:13, and "a rolling
   thing" in Isa. 17:13; R.V. in both, "whirling dust"). This word
   has been supposed to mean the wild artichoke, which assumes the
   form of a globe, and in autumn breaks away from its roots, and
   is rolled about by the wind in some places in great numbers.

          [1913 Webster]

   Note: This mode of torture is said to have been first
         employed in Germany, in the fourteenth century. The
         criminal was laid on a cart wheel with his legs and
         arms extended, and his limbs in that posture were
         fractured with an iron bar. In France, where its use
         was restricted to the most atrocious crimes, the
         criminal was first laid on a frame of wood in the form
         of a St. Andrew's cross, with grooves cut transversely
         in it above and below the knees and elbows, and the
         executioner struck eight blows with an iron bar, so as
         to break the limbs in those places, sometimes finishing
         by two or three blows on the chest or stomach, which
         usually put an end to the life of the criminal, and
         were hence called coups-de-grace -- blows of mercy. The
         criminal was then unbound, and laid on a small wheel,
         with his face upward, and his arms and legs doubled
         under him, there to expire, if he had survived the
         previous treatment. --Brande.
         [1913 Webster]
      (c) (Naut.) A circular frame having handles on the
          periphery, and an axle which is so connected with the
          tiller as to form a means of controlling the rudder
          for the purpose of steering.

         supposed from the context in the few cases where the
         word is found.'' --Nares.
         [1913 Webster]

               You must sing a-down a-down,
               An you call him a-down-a.
               O, how the wheel becomes it!       --Shak.
