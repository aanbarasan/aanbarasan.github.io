        1. [on BBSes] Any of a species of {luser} resembling a less
        amusing version of {BIFF} that infests many {BBS}es.  The
        typical weenie is a teenage boy with poor social skills
        travelling under a grandiose {handle} derived from fantasy or
        heavy-metal rock lyrics.  Among {sysop}s, "the weenie problem"
        refers to the marginally literate and profanity-laden
        {flamage} weenies tend to spew all over a newly-discovered
        BBS.
     
        Compare {spod}, {computer geek}, {terminal junkie}.
     
        2. Among hackers, when used with a qualifier (for example, as
        in {Unix weenie}, {VMS} weenie, {IBM} weenie) this can be
        either an insult or a term of praise, depending on context,
        tone of voice, and whether or not it is applied by a person
        who considers him or herself to be the same sort of weenie.
        It implies that the weenie has put a major investment of time,
        effort and concentration into the area indicated; whether this
        is good or bad depends on the hearer's judgment of how the
        speaker feels about that area.  See also {bigot}.
     
        3. The {semicolon} character, ";" ({ASCII} 59).
