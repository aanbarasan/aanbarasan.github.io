   Introduction World
   ------------------
                            Background: Globally, the 20th century was
                                        marked by: (a) two devastating world
                                        wars; (b) the Great Depression of
                                        the 1930s; (c) the end of vast
                                        colonial empires; (d) rapid advances
                                        in science and technology, from the
                                        first airplane flight at Kitty Hawk,
                                        North Carolina (US) to the landing
                                        on the moon; (e) the Cold War
                                        between the Western alliance and the
                                        Warsaw Pact nations; (f) a sharp
                                        rise in living standards in North
                                        America, Europe, and Japan; (g)
                                        increased concerns about the
                                        environment, including loss of
                                        forests, shortages of energy and
                                        water, the decline in biological
                                        diversity, and air pollution; (h)
                                        the onset of the AIDS epidemic; and
                                        (i) the ultimate emergence of the US
                                        as the only world superpower. The
                                        planet's population continues to
                                        explode: from 1 billion in 1820, to
                                        2 billion in 1930, 3 billion in
                                        1960, 4 billion in 1974, 5 billion
                                        in 1988, and 6 billion in 2000. For
                                        the 21st century, the continued
                                        exponential growth in science and
                                        technology raises both hopes (e.g.,
                                        advances in medicine) and fears
                                        (e.g., development of even more
                                        lethal weapons of war).

   Economy World
   -------------
                    Economy - overview: Growth in global output (gross world
                                        product, GWP) fell from 4.8% in 2000
                                        to 2.2% in 2001. The causes:
                                        slowdowns in the US economy (21% of
                                        GWP) and in the 15 EU economies (20%
                                        of GWP); continued stagnation in the
                                        Japanese economy (7.3% of GWP); and
                                        spillover effects in the less
                                        developed regions of the world.
                                        China, the second largest economy in
                                        the world (12% of GWP), proved an
                                        exception, continuing its rapid
                                        annual growth, officially announced
                                        as 7.3% but estimated by many
                                        observers as perhaps two percentage
                                        points lower. Russia (2.6% of GWP),
                                        with 5.2% growth, continued to make
                                        uneven progress, its GDP per capita
                                        still only one-third that of the
                                        leading industrial nations. The
                                        other 14 successor nations of the
                                        USSR and the other old Warsaw Pact
                                        nations again experienced widely
                                        divergent growth rates; the three
                                        Baltic nations were strong
                                        performers, in the 5% range of
                                        growth. The developing nations also
                                        varied in their growth results, with
                                        many countries facing population
                                        increases that eat up gains in
                                        output. Externally, the nation-
                                        state, as a bedrock economic-
                                        political institution, is steadily
                                        losing control over international
                                        flows of people, goods, funds, and
                                        technology. Internally, the central
                                        government often finds its control
                                        over resources slipping as
                                        separatist regional movements -
                                        typically based on ethnicity - gain
                                        momentum, e.g., in many of the
                                        successor states of the former
                                        Soviet Union, in the former
                                        Yugoslavia, in India, in Indonesia,
                                        and in Canada. In Western Europe,
                                        governments face the difficult
                                        political problem of channeling
                                        resources away from welfare programs
                                        in order to increase investment and
                                        strengthen incentives to seek
                                        employment. The addition of 80
                                        million people each year to an
                                        already overcrowded globe is
                                        exacerbating the problems of
                                        pollution, desertification,
                                        underemployment, epidemics, and
                                        famine. Because of their own
                                        internal problems and priorities,
                                        the industrialized countries devote
                                        insufficient resources to deal
                                        effectively with the poorer areas of
                                        the world, which, at least from the
                                        economic point of view, are becoming
                                        further marginalized. The
                                        introduction of the euro as the
                                        common currency of much of Western
                                        Europe in January 1999, while paving
                                        the way for an integrated economic
                                        powerhouse, poses economic risks
                                        because of varying levels of income
                                        and cultural and political
