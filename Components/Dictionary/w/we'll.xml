      <WordDefinition>Well
   (Heb. beer), to be distinguished from a fountain (Heb. 'ain). A
   "beer" was a deep shaft, bored far under the rocky surface by
   the art of man, which contained water which percolated through
   the strata in its sides. Such wells were those of Jacob and
   Beersheba, etc. (see Gen. 21:19, 25, 30, 31; 24:11; 26:15,
   18-25, 32, etc.). In the Pentateuch this word beer, so rendered,
   occurs twenty-five times.

   Note: Well, like above, ill, and so, is used before many

         formed at will, only a few of this class are given in
         the Vocabulary.
         [1913 Webster]
