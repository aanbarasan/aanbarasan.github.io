      <WordDefinition>Watch \Watch\ (w[o^]ch), n. [OE. wacche, AS. w[ae]cce, fr.
   wacian to wake; akin to D. wacht, waak, G. wacht, wache.
   [root]134. See {Wake}, v. i. ]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. The act of watching; forbearance of sleep; vigil; wakeful,
      vigilant, or constantly observant attention; close
      observation; guard; preservative or preventive vigilance;
      formerly, a watching or guarding by night.
      [1913 Webster]

      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Watch was formerly distinguished from ward, the former
         signifying a watching or guarding by night, and the
         latter a watching, guarding, or protecting by day
         Hence, they were not unfrequently used together,
         especially in the phrase to keep watch and ward, to
         denote continuous and uninterrupted vigilance or
         protection, or both watching and guarding. This
         distinction is now rarely recognized, watch being used
         to signify a watching or guarding both by night and by
         day, and ward, which is now rarely used, having simply
         the meaning of guard, or protection, without reference
         to time.
         [1913 Webster]

               Still, when she slept, he kept both watch and
               ward.                              --Spenser.
         [1913 Webster]

               the daytime, in order to apprehend rioters, and

               applicable to the night only, . . . and it begins
               when ward ends, and ends when that begins.
                                                  --Blackstone.
         [1913 Webster]

            make it as sure as ye can.            --Matt. xxvii.

      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Fright; affright; terror; trepidation; apprehension;
        consternation; dismay; agitation; disquiet; disquietude.

   Usage: {Alarm}, {Fright}, {Terror}, {Consternation}. These
          words express different degrees of fear at the
          approach of danger. Fright is fear suddenly excited,
          producing confusion of the senses, and hence it is
          unreflecting. Alarm is the hurried agitation of
          feeling which springs from a sense of immediate and
          extreme exposure. Terror is agitating and excessive
          fear, which usually benumbs the faculties.
          Consternation is overwhelming fear, and carries a
          notion of powerlessness and amazement. Alarm agitates
          the feelings; terror disorders the understanding and
          affects the will; fright seizes on and confuses the
          sense; consternation takes possession of the soul, and
          subdues its faculties. See {Apprehension}.
