      <WordDefinition>win [MIT; now common everywhere] 1. vi. To succeed. A program wins if
   no unexpected conditions arise, or (especially) if it is sufficiently
   {robust} to take exceptions in stride. 2. n. Success, or a specific
   instance thereof. A pleasing outcome. "So it turned out I could use a
   {lexer} generator instead of hand-coding my own pattern recognizer. What
   a win!" Emphatic forms: `moby win', `super win', `hyper-win' (often used
   interjectively as a reply). For some reason `suitable win' is also
   common at MIT, usually in reference to a satisfactory solution to a
   problem. Oppose {lose}; see also {big win}, which isn't quite just an
   intensification of `win'.
