      <WordDefinition>Wagon
   Heb. aghalah; so rendered in Gen. 45:19, 21, 27; 46:5; Num. 7:3,
   7,8, but elsewhere rendered "cart" (1 Sam. 6:7, etc.). This
   vehicle was used for peaceful purposes. In Ezek. 23:24, however,
   it is the rendering of a different Hebrew word, and denotes a
   war-chariot.

         etymologically preferable, and in the United States are
