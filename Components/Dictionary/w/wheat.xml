      <WordDefinition>WHEAT, n.  A cereal from which a tolerably good whisky can with some
difficulty be made, and which is used also for bread.  The French are
said to eat more bread _per capita_ of population than any other
people, which is natural, for only they know how to make the stuff
palatable.

      <WordDefinition>Wheat
   one of the earliest cultivated grains. It bore the Hebrew name
   _hittah_, and was extensively cultivated in Palestine. There are
   various species of wheat. That which Pharaoh saw in his dream
   was the Triticum compositum, which bears several ears upon one
   stalk (Gen. 41:5). The "fat of the kidneys of wheat" (Deut.
   32:14), and the "finest of the wheat" (Ps. 81:16; 147:14),
   denote the best of the kind. It was exported from Palestine in
   great quantities (1 Kings 5:11; Ezek. 27:17; Acts 12:20).
   
     Parched grains of wheat were used for food in Palestine (Ruth
   2:14; 1 Sam. 17:17; 2 Sam. 17:28). The disciples, under the
   sanction of the Mosaic law (Deut. 23:25), plucked ears of corn,
   and rubbing them in their hands, ate the grain unroasted (Matt.
   12:1; Mark 2:23; Luke 6:1). Before any of the wheat-harvest,
   however, could be eaten, the first-fruits had to be presented
   before the Lord (Lev. 23:14).

      <WordDefinition>Wheat \Wheat\ (hw[=e]t), n. [OE. whete, AS. hw[=ae]te; akin to

         white wheat, bald wheat, bearded wheat, winter wheat,
