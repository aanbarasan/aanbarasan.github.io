      <WordDefinition>Wisdom \Wis"dom\ (-d[u^]m), n. [AS. w[imac]sd[=o]m. See {Wise},
   a., and {-dom}.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. The quality of being wise; knowledge, and the capacity to
      make due use of it; knowledge of the best ends and the
      best means; discernment and judgment; discretion;
      sagacity; skill; dexterity.
      [1913 Webster]

            We speak also not in wise words of man's wisdom, but
            in the doctrine of the spirit.        --Wyclif (1
                                                  Cor. ii. 13).
      [1913 Webster]

            Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to
            depart from evil is understanding.    --Job xxviii.
                                                  28.
      [1913 Webster]

            It is hoped that our rulers will act with dignity
            and wisdom that they will yield everything to
            reason, and refuse everything to force. --Ames.
      [1913 Webster]

            Common sense in an uncommon degree is what the world
            calls wisdom.                         --Coleridge.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. The results of wise judgments; scientific or practical
      truth; acquired knowledge; erudition.
      [1913 Webster]

            Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the
            Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
                                                  --Acts vii.
                                                  22.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Prudence; knowledge.

   Usage: {Wisdom}, {Prudence}, {Knowledge}. Wisdom has been
          defined to be ``the use of the best means for
          attaining the best ends.'' ``We conceive,'' says
          Whewell, `` prudence as the virtue by which we select
          right means for given ends, while wisdom implies the
          selection of right ends as well as of right means.''
          Hence, wisdom implies the union of high mental and
          moral excellence. Prudence (that is, providence, or
          forecast) is of a more negative character; it rather
          consists in avoiding danger than in taking decisive
          measures for the accomplishment of an object. Sir
          Robert Walpole was in many respects a prudent
          statesman, but he was far from being a wise one. Burke
          has said that prudence, when carried too far,
          degenerates into a ``reptile virtue,'' which is the
          more dangerous for its plausible appearance.
          Knowledge, a more comprehensive term, signifies the
          simple apprehension of facts or relations. ``In
          strictness of language,'' says Paley, `` there is a
          difference between knowledge and wisdom; wisdom always
          supposing action, and action directed by it.''
          [1913 Webster]

                Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one,
                Have ofttimes no connection. Knowledge dwells
                In heads replete with thoughts of other men;
                Wisdom, in minds attentive to their own.
                Knowledge, a rude, unprofitable mass,
                The mere materials with which wisdom builds,
                Till smoothed, and squared, and fitted to its
                place,
                Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich.
                Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much;
                Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.
                                                  --Cowper.
          [1913 Webster]

   {Wisdom tooth}, the last, or back, tooth of the full set on
      each half of each jaw in man; -- familiarly so called,
      because appearing comparatively late, after the person may
      be supposed to have arrived at the age of wisdom. See the
      Note under {Tooth}, 1.
