      <WordDefinition>Wonder \Won"der\, n. [OE. wonder, wunder, AS. wundor; akin to D.
   wonder, OS. wundar, OHG. wuntar, G. wunder, Icel. undr, Sw. &amp;
   Dan. under, and perhaps to Gr. ? to gaze at.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. That emotion which is excited by novelty, or the
      presentation to the sight or mind of something new,
      unusual, strange, great, extraordinary, or not well
      understood; surprise; astonishment; admiration; amazement.
      [1913 Webster]

            They were filled with wonder and amazement at that
            which had happened unto him.          --Acts iii.
                                                  10.
      [1913 Webster]

            Wonder is the effect of novelty upon ignorance.
                                                  --Johnson.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Wonder expresses less than astonishment, and much less
         than amazement. It differs from admiration, as now
         used, in not being necessarily accompanied with love,
         esteem, or approbation.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. A cause of wonder; that which excites surprise; a strange
      thing; a prodigy; a miracle. `` Babylon, the wonder of all
      tongues.'' --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

            To try things oft, and never to give over, doth
            wonders.                              --Bacon.
      [1913 Webster]

            I am as a wonder unto many.           --Ps. lxxi. 7.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Seven wonders of the world}. See in the Dictionary of Noted
      Names in Fiction.
