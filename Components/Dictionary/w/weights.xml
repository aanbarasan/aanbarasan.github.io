      <WordDefinition>Weights
   Reduced to English troy-weight, the Hebrew weights were: (1.)
   The gerah (Lev. 27:25; Num. 3:47), a Hebrew word, meaning a
   grain or kernel, and hence a small weight. It was the twentieth
   part of a shekel, and equal to 12 grains.
   
     (2.) Bekah (Ex. 38:26), meaning "a half" i.e., "half a
   shekel," equal to 5 pennyweight.
   
     (3.) Shekel, "a weight," only in the Old Testament, and
   frequently in its original form (Gen. 23:15, 16; Ex. 21:32;
   30:13, 15; 38:24-29, etc.). It was equal to 10 pennyweight.
   
     (4.) Ma'neh, "a part" or "portion" (Ezek. 45:12), equal to 60
   shekels, i.e., to 2 lbs. 6 oz.
   
     (5.) Talent of silver (2 Kings 5:22), equal to 3,000 shekels,
   i.e., 125 lbs.
   
     (6.) Talent of gold (Ex. 25:39), double the preceding, i.e.,
   250 lbs.
