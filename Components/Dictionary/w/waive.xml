   Note: The term was applied to a woman, in the same sense as
         outlaw to a man. A woman could not be outlawed, in the
         proper sense of the word, because, according to
         Bracton, she was never in law, that is, in a
         frankpledge or decennary; but she might be waived, and
         held as abandoned. --Burrill.
