      <WordDefinition>while
     
        &lt;programming&gt; The {loop} construct found in nearly all
        {imperative} programming languages which executes one or more
        instructions (the "loop body") repeatedly so long as some
        condition evaluates to true.  In contrast to a {repeat} loop,
        the loop body will not be executed at all if the condition is
        false on entry to the while.
     
        For example, in {C}, a while loop is written
     
        	while (&lt;expr&gt;) &lt;statement&gt;;
     
        where &lt;expr&gt; is any expression and &lt;statement&gt; is any
        statement, including a compound statement within braces
         "{..}".
