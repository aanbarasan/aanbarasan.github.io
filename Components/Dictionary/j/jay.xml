      <WordDefinition>Jay \Jay\, n. [F. geai, OF. gai, jaj, perh. fr. OHG. g[=a]hi.
   Cf. {Gay}.] (Zo["o]l.)
   Any one of the numerous species of birds belonging to
   {Garrulus}, {Cyanocitta}, and allied genera of the family
   {Corvidae}. They are allied to the crows, but are smaller,
   more graceful in form, often handsomely colored, and usually
   have a crest.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The European jay ({Garrulus glandarius}) is a large and
         handsomely colored species, having the body pale
         reddish brown, lighter beneath; tail and wing quills
         blackish; the primary coverts barred with bright blue
         and black; throat, tail coverts, and a large spot on
         the wings, white. Called also {jay pie}, {Jenny jay},
         and {k[ae]}. The common {blue jay} ({Cyanocitta
         cristata}.), and the related species, are brilliantly
         colored, and have a large erectile crest. The
         California jay ({Aphelocoma Californica}), the Florida
         jay ({Aphelocoma Floridana}), and the green jay
         ({Xanthoura luxuosa}), of Texas and Mexico, are large,
         handsome, crested species. The Canada jay ({Perisoreus
         Canadensis}), and several allied species, are much
         plainer and have no crest. See {Blue jay}, and {Whisky
         jack}.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Jay thrush} (Zo["o]l.), any one several species of Asiatic
      singing birds, of the genera {Garrulax}, {Grammatoptila},
      and related genera of the family {Crateropodid[ae]}; as,
      the white-throated {jay thrush} ({Garrulax albogularis})
      (also called the {white-throated laughingthrush}), of
      India.
