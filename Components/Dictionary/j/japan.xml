   Introduction Japan
   ------------------
                            Background: While retaining its time-honored
                                        culture, Japan rapidly absorbed
                                        Western technology during the late
                                        19th and early 20th centuries. After
                                        its devastating defeat in World War
                                        II, Japan recovered to become the
                                        second most powerful economy in the
                                        world and a staunch ally of the US.
                                        While the emperor retains his throne
                                        as a symbol of national unity,
                                        actual power rests in networks of
                                        powerful politicians, bureaucrats,
                                        and business executives. The economy
                                        experienced a major slowdown in the
                                        1990s following three decades of
                                        unprecedented growth.

                                        small defense allocation (1% of GDP)
                                        have helped Japan advance with
                                        extraordinary rapidity to the rank
                                        of second most technologically
                                        powerful economy in the world after
                                        the US and third largest economy in
                                        the world after the US and China.
                                        One notable characteristic of the
                                        economy is the working together of
                                        manufacturers, suppliers, and
                                        distributors in closely-knit groups
                                        called keiretsu. A second basic
                                        feature has been the guarantee of
                                        lifetime employment for a
                                        substantial portion of the urban
                                        labor force. Both features are now
                                        eroding. Industry, the most
                                        important sector of the economy, is
                                        heavily dependent on imported raw
                                        materials and fuels. The much
                                        smaller agricultural sector is
                                        highly subsidized and protected,
                                        with crop yields among the highest
                                        in the world. Usually self-
                                        sufficient in rice, Japan must
                                        import about 50% of its requirements
                                        of other grain and fodder crops.
                                        Japan maintains one of the world's
                                        largest fishing fleets and accounts
                                        for nearly 15% of the global catch.
                                        For three decades overall real
                                        economic growth had been
                                        spectacular: a 10% average in the
                                        1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s,
                                        and a 4% average in the 1980s.
                                        Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s
                                        largely because of the aftereffects
                                        of overinvestment during the late
                                        1980s and contractionary domestic
                                        policies intended to wring
                                        speculative excesses from the stock
                                        and real estate markets. Government
                                        efforts to revive economic growth
                                        have met with little success and
                                        were further hampered in 2000-01 by
                                        the slowing of the US and Asian
                                        economies. The crowding of habitable
                                        land area and the aging of the
                                        population are two major long-run
                                        problems. Robotics constitutes a key
                                        long-term economic strength, with
                                        Japan possessing 410,000 of the
                                        world's 720,000 "working robots".
