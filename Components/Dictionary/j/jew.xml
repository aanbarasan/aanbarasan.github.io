      <WordDefinition>Jew
   the name derived from the patriarch Judah, at first given to one
   belonging to the tribe of Judah or to the separate kingdom of
   Judah (2 Kings 16:6; 25:25; Jer. 32:12; 38:19; 40:11; 41:3), in
   contradistinction from those belonging to the kingdom of the ten
   tribes, who were called Israelites.
   
     During the Captivity, and after the Restoration, the name,
   however, was extended to all the Hebrew nation without
   distinction (Esther 3:6, 10; Dan. 3:8, 12; Ezra 4:12; 5:1, 5).
   
     Originally this people were called Hebrews (Gen. 39:14; 40:15;
   Ex. 2:7; 3:18; 5:3; 1 Sam. 4:6, 9, etc.), but after the Exile
   this name fell into disuse. But Paul was styled a Hebrew (2 Cor.
   11:22; Phil. 3:5).
   
     The history of the Jewish nation is interwoven with the
   history of Palestine and with the narratives of the lives of
   their rulers and chief men. They are now [1897] dispersed over
   all lands, and to this day remain a separate people, "without a
   king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without
   an image [R.V. 'pillar,' marg. 'obelisk'], and without an ephod,
   and without teraphim" (Hos. 3:4). Till about the beginning of
   the present century [1800] they were everywhere greatly
   oppressed, and often cruelly persecuted; but now their condition
   is greatly improved, and they are admitted in most European
   countries to all the rights of free citizens. In 1860 the
   "Jewish disabilities" were removed, and they were admitted to a
   seat in the British Parliament. Their number in all is estimated
   at about six millions, about four millions being in Europe.
   
     There are three names used in the New Testament to designate
   this people, (1.) Jews, as regards their nationality, to
   distinguish them from Gentiles. (2.) Hebrews, with regard to
   their language and education, to distinguish them from
   Hellenists, i.e., Jews who spoke the Greek language. (3.)
   Israelites, as respects their sacred privileges as the chosen
   people of God. "To other races we owe the splendid inheritance
   of modern civilization and secular culture; but the religious
   education of mankind has been the gift of the Jew alone."
