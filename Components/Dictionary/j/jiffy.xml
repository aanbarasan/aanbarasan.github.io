      <WordDefinition>jiffy
     
        1. The duration of one {tick} of the computer's {system
        clock}.  Often one AC cycle time (1/60 second in the US and
        Canada, 1/50 most other places), but more recently 1/100 sec
        has become common.
     
        2. Confusingly, the term is sometimes also used for a
        1-millisecond {wall time} interval.  Even more confusingly,
        physicists semi-jokingly use "jiffy" to mean the time required
        for light to travel one foot in a vacuum, which turns out to
        be close to one *nanosecond*.

      <WordDefinition>jiffy n. 1. The duration of one tick of the system clock on your
   computer (see {tick}). Often one AC cycle time (1/60 second in the U.S.
   and Canada, 1/50 most other places), but more recently 1/100 sec has
   become common. "The swapper runs every 6 jiffies" means that the virtual
   memory management routine is executed once for every 6 ticks of the
   clock, or about ten times a second. 2. Confusingly, the term is
   sometimes also used for a 1-millisecond {wall time} interval. 3. Even
   more confusingly, physicists semi-jokingly use `jiffy' to mean the time
   required for light to travel one foot in a vacuum, which turns out to be
   close to one _nanosecond_. 4. Indeterminate time from a few seconds to
   forever. "I'll do it in a jiffy" means certainly not now and possibly
   never. This is a bit contrary to the more widespread use of the word.
   Oppose {nano}. See also {Real Soon Now}.
