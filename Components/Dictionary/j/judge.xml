      <WordDefinition>Judge
   (Heb. shophet, pl. shophetim), properly a magistrate or ruler,
   rather than one who judges in the sense of trying a cause. This
   is the name given to those rulers who presided over the affairs
   of the Israelites during the interval between the death of
   Joshua and the accession of Saul (Judg. 2:18), a period of
   general anarchy and confusion. "The office of judges or regents
   was held during life, but it was not hereditary, neither could
   they appoint their successors. Their authority was limited by
   the law alone, and in doubtful cases they were directed to
   consult the divine King through the priest by Urim and Thummim
   (Num. 27:21). Their authority extended only over those tribes by
   whom they had been elected or acknowledged. There was no income
   attached to their office, and they bore no external marks of
   dignity. The only cases of direct divine appointment are those
   of Gideon and Samson, and the latter stood in the peculiar
   position of having been from before his birth ordained 'to begin
   to deliver Israel.' Deborah was called to deliver Israel, but
   was already a judge. Samuel was called by the Lord to be a
   prophet but not a judge, which ensued from the high gifts the
   people recognized as dwelling in him; and as to Eli, the office
   of judge seems to have devolved naturally or rather ex officio
   upon him." Of five of the judges, Tola (Judg. 10:1), Jair (3),
   Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8-15), we have no record at all
   beyond the bare fact that they were judges. Sacred history is
   not the history of individuals but of the kingdom of God in its
   onward progress.
   
     In Ex. 2:14 Moses is so styled. This fact may indicate that
   while for revenue purposes the "taskmasters" were over the
   people, they were yet, just as at a later time when under the
   Romans, governed by their own rulers.

      [1913 Webster]

            The parts of a judge in hearing are four: to direct
            the evidence; to moderate length, repetition, or
            impertinency of speech; to recapitulate, select, and
            collate the material points of that which hath been
            said; and to give the rule or sentence. --Bacon.

   {Judge Advocate} (Mil. &amp; Nav.), a person appointed to act as
      prosecutor at a court-martial; he acts as the
      representative of the government, as the responsible
      adviser of the court, and also, to a certain extent, as
      counsel for the accused, when he has no other counsel.

   {Judge-Advocate General}, in the United States, the title of
      two officers, one attached to the War Department and
      having the rank of brigadier general, the other attached
      to the Navy Department and having the rank of colonel of
      marines or captain in the navy. The first is chief of the
      Bureau of Military Justice of the army, the other performs
      a similar duty for the navy. In England, the designation
      of a member of the ministry who is the legal adviser of
      the secretary of state for war, and supreme judge of the
      proceedings of courts-martial.

   Syn: {Judge}, {Umpire}, {Arbitrator}, {Referee}.

   Usage: A judge, in the legal sense, is a magistrate appointed
          to determine questions of law. An umpire is a person
          selected to decide between two or more who contend for
          a prize. An arbitrator is one chosen to allot to two
          contestants their portion of a claim, usually on
          grounds of equity and common sense. A referee is one
          to whom a case is referred for final adjustment.
          Arbitrations and references are sometimes voluntary,
          sometimes appointed by a court.
