      <WordDefinition>Jonah
   a dove, the son of Amittai of Gath-hepher. He was a prophet of
   Israel, and predicted the restoration of the ancient boundaries
   (2 Kings 14:25-27) of the kingdom. He exercised his ministry
   very early in the reign of Jeroboam II., and thus was
   contemporary with Hosea and Amos; or possibly he preceded them,
   and consequently may have been the very oldest of all the
   prophets whose writings we possess. His personal history is
   mainly to be gathered from the book which bears his name. It is
   chiefly interesting from the two-fold character in which he
   appears, (1) as a missionary to heathen Nineveh, and (2) as a
   type of the "Son of man."
