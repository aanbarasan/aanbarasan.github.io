      <WordDefinition>Jupiter
   the principal deity of the ancient Greeks and Romans. He was
   worshipped by them under various epithets. Barnabas was
   identified with this god by the Lycaonians (Acts 14:12), because
   he was of stately and commanding presence, as they supposed
   Jupiter to be. There was a temple dedicated to this god outside
   the gates of Lystra (14:13).

      <WordDefinition>Jupiter \Ju"pi*ter\, n. [L., fr. Jovis pater. See {Jove}.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. (Rom. Myth.) The supreme deity, king of gods and men, and
      reputed to be the son of Saturn and Rhea; Jove. He
      corresponds to the Greek Zeus.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Astron.) One of the planets, being the fifth from the
      sun, the brightest except Venus, and the largest of them
      all, its mean radius being about 43,345 miles (69,758
      kilometers), almost exactly one-tenth that of the sun. It
      revolves about the sun in 4,332.6 days, at a mean distance
      of 5.2025 from the sun (778,140,000 km), the earth's mean
      distance (the astronomical unit) being taken as unity. It
      has a mass of 1.901 x 10^{27} kg, about one-thousandth
      that of the sun, and more than the remainder of the
      planets combined. It has an average solar day equal to
      9.842 earth hours. The rapid revolution causes a
      noticeable flattening at the poles; the diameter at the
      equator is 71,370 km, and at the poles 66,644 km. --HCP61
      [1913 Webster +PJC]

          from its massive inflorescence, like the sculptured
          beard of Jove. --Prior.
      (c) the cloverlike {Anthyllis Barba-Jovis}.

   {Jupiter's staff} (Bot.), the common mullein; -- so called
      from its long, rigid spike of yellow blossoms.
