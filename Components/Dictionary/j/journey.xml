      <WordDefinition>Journey \Jour"ney\, n.; pl. {Journeys}. [OE. jornee, journee,
   prop., a day's journey, OF. jorn['e]e, jurn['e]e, a day, a
   day's work of journey, F. journ['e]e, fr. OF. jorn, jurn, jor
   a day, F. jour, fr. L. diurnus. See {Journal}.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. The travel or work of a day. [Obs.] --Chaucer.

            We have yet large day, for scarce the sun
            Hath finished half his journey.       --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Travel or passage from one place to another, especially
      one covering a large distance or taking a long time.
      [1913 Webster]

            The good man . . . is gone a long journey. --Prov.
                                                  vii. 19.

   4. The distance that is traveled in a journey[2], or the time
      taken to complete a journey[2]; as, it's a two-day journey

      [PJC]

   Syn: Tour; excursion; trip; expedition; pilgrimage; jaunt.

   Usage: {Journey}, {Tour}, {Excursion}, {Pilgrimage}. The word
          journey suggests the idea of a somewhat prolonged
          traveling for a specific object, leading a person to
          pass directly from one point to another. In a tour, we
          take a roundabout course from place to place, more
          commonly for pleasure, though sometimes on business.
          An excursion is usually a brief tour or trip for
          pleasure, health, etc. In a pilgrimage we travel to a
          place hallowed by our religions affections, or by some
          train of sacred or tender associations. A journey on
          important business; the tour of Europe; an excursion
          to the lakes; a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
