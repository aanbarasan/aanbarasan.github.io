   Syn: To joke; sport; rally.

   Usage: To {Jest}, {Joke}. One jests in order to make others

          at the expense of another, and is often ill-natured; a
          joke is a sportive sally designed to promote good
          humor without wounding the feelings of its object.
          ``Jests are, therefore, seldom harmless; jokes
          frequently allowable. The most serious subject may be
          degraded by being turned into a jest.'' --Crabb.
