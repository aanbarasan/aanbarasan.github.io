      <WordDefinition>Jell-O \Jell"-O\, jello \jell"o\n. [a trademark.]
   a brand of sweetened fruit-flavored powdered mixture,
   packaged so that it can be conveniently dissolved in hot
   water and solidified into a gelatin, used as a dessert,
   sometimes with pieces of fruit mixed in; also the gelatin
   dessert thus prepared; sometimes used metaphorically; as,
   when he pulled a gun on me, my knees turned to Jell-O..
   [Trademark]

   Note: Jell-O was originally a trademark and is still
         protected by trademark law, but is often used as one
         word, uncapitalized in informal writing.

      <WordDefinition>jello n. [Usenet: by analogy with {spam}] A message that is both
   excessively cross-posted and too frequently posted, as opposed to {spam}
   (which is merely too frequently posted) or {velveeta} (which is merely
   excessively cross-posted). This term is widely recognized but not
   commonly used; most people refer to both kinds of abuse or their
   combination as spam.
