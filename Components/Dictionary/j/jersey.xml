   Introduction Jersey
   -------------------
                             Background: The island of Jersey and the other
                                         Channel Islands represent the last
                                         remnants of the medieval Dukedom of
                                         Normandy that held sway in both
                                         France and England. These islands
                                         were the only British soil occupied
                                         by German troops in World War II.

   Economy Jersey
   --------------
                    Economy - overview: The economy is based largely on
                                        international financial services,
                                        agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes,
                                        cauliflower, tomatoes, and
                                        especially flowers are important
                                        export crops, shipped mostly to the
                                        UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle
                                        is known worldwide and represents an
                                        important export income earner. Milk
                                        products go to the UK and other EU
                                        countries. In 1996 the finance
                                        sector accounted for about 60% of
                                        the island's output. Tourism,
                                        another mainstay of the economy,
                                        accounts for 24% of GDP. In recent
                                        years, the government has encouraged
                                        light industry to locate in Jersey,
                                        with the result that an electronics
                                        industry has developed alongside the
                                        traditional manufacturing of
                                        knitwear. All raw material and
                                        energy requirements are imported, as
                                        well as a large share of Jersey's
                                        food needs. Light taxes and death
                                        duties make the island a popular tax
                                        haven.
