      <WordDefinition>Joy
     
        &lt;language&gt; A {functional programming} language by Manfred von
        Thun.  Joy is unusual because it is not based on {lambda
        calculus}, but on the {composition} of {functions}.  Functions
        take a stack as argument, consume any number of parameters
        from it, and return it with any number of results on it.  The
        concatenation of programs denotes the composition of
        functions.  One of the datatypes of Joy is that of quoted
        programs, of which lists are a special case.
