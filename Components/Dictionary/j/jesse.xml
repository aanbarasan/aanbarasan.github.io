      <WordDefinition>Jesse
   firm, or a gift, a son of Obed, the son of Boaz and Ruth (Ruth
   4:17, 22; Matt. 1:5, 6; Luke 3:32). He was the father of eight
   sons, the youngest of whom was David (1 Sam. 17:12). The phrase
   "stem of Jesse" is used for the family of David (Isa. 11:1), and
   "root of Jesse" for the Messiah (Isa. 11:10; Rev. 5:5). Jesse
   was a man apparently of wealth and position at Bethlehem (1 Sam.
   17:17, 18, 20; Ps. 78:71). The last reference to him is of
   David's procuring for him an asylum with the king of Moab (1
   Sam. 22:3).
