      <WordDefinition>zombie n. 1. [Unix] A process that has died but has not yet
   relinquished its process table slot (because the parent process hasn't
   executed a `wait(2)' for it yet). These can be seen in `ps(1)' listings
   occasionally. Compare {orphan}. 2. A machine, especially someone's {home
   box}, that has been cracked and is being used as part of a second-stage
   attack by miscreants trying to mask their home IP address. Especially
   used of machines being exploited in large gangs for a mechanized
   denial-of-service attack like Tribe Flood Network; the image that goes
   with this is of a veritable army of zombies mindlessly doing the bidding
   of a necromancer.
