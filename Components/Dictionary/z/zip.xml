        1. &lt;tool, compression, file format&gt; To create a compressed
        {archive} (a "zip file") from one or more files using
        {PKWare}'s {PKZIP} or a compatible {archiver}.  Its use is
        spreading from {MS-DOS} now that portable implementations of
        the {algorithm} have been written.
     
        zip is also the name of a {Unix} archiving utility compatible
        with {PKZIP}.  {unzip} is the corresponding de-archiver.
     
        See also {gzip}, {tar and feather}.
     
        2. &lt;storage&gt; {Zip Drive}.
