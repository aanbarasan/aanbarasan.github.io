        &lt;games&gt; /zork/ The second of the great early experiments in
        computer fantasy gaming; see {ADVENT}.  Zork was originally
        written on {MIT-DM} during the late 1970s, later distributed
        with {BSD Unix} as a patched, sourceless {RT-11} {Fortran}
        binary (see {retrocomputing}) and commercialised as "The Zork
        Trilogy" by {Infocom}.  The Fortran source was later rewritten
        for portability and released to {Usenet} under the name
        "Dungeon".
     
        Both Fortran "Dungeon" and translated {C} versions are
        available from many {FTP archives}.
