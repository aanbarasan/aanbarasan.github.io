      <WordDefinition>David
   beloved, the eighth and youngest son of Jesse, a citizen of
   Bethlehem. His father seems to have been a man in humble life.
   His mother's name is not recorded. Some think she was the Nahash
   of 2 Sam. 17:25. As to his personal appearance, we only know
   that he was red-haired, with beautiful eyes and a fair face (1
   Sam. 16:12; 17:42).
   
     His early occupation was that of tending his father's sheep on
   the uplands of Judah. From what we know of his after history,
   doubtless he frequently beguiled his time, when thus engaged,
   with his shepherd's flute, while he drank in the many lessons
   taught him by the varied scenes spread around him. His first
   recorded exploits were his encounters with the wild beasts of
   the field. He mentions that with his own unaided hand he slew a
   lion and also a bear, when they came out against his flock,
   beating them to death in open conflict with his club (1 Sam.
   17:34, 35).
   
     While David, in the freshness of ruddy youth, was thus engaged
   with his flocks, Samuel paid an unexpected visit to Bethlehem,
   having been guided thither by divine direction (1 Sam. 16:1-13).
   There he offered up sacrifice, and called the elders of Israel
   and Jesse's family to the sacrificial meal. Among all who
   appeared before him he failed to discover the one he sought.
   David was sent for, and the prophet immediately recognized him
   as the chosen of God, chosen to succeed Saul, who was now
   departing from the ways of God, on the throne of the kingdom. He
   accordingly, in anticipation, poured on his head the anointing
   oil. David went back again to his shepherd life, but "the Spirit
   of the Lord came upon David from that day forward," and "the
   Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul" (1 Sam. 16:13, 14).
   
     Not long after this David was sent for to soothe with his harp
   the troubled spirit of Saul, who suffered from a strange
   melancholy dejection. He played before the king so skilfully
   that Saul was greatly cheered, and began to entertain great
   affection for the young shepherd. After this he went home to
   Bethlehem. But he soon again came into prominence. The armies of
   the Philistines and of Israel were in battle array in the valley
   of Elah, some 16 miles south-west of Bethlehem; and David was
   sent by his father with provisions for his three brothers, who
   were then fighting on the side of the king. On his arrival in
   the camp of Israel, David (now about twenty years of age) was
   made aware of the state of matters when the champion of the
   Philistines, Goliath of Gath, came forth to defy Israel. David
   took his sling, and with a well-trained aim threw a stone "out
   of the brook," which struck the giant's forehead, so that he
   fell senseless to the ground. David then ran and slew him, and
   cut off his head with his own sword (1 Sam. 17). The result was
   a great victory to the Israelites, who pursued the Philistines
   to the gates of Gath and Ekron.
   
     David's popularity consequent on this heroic exploit awakened
   Saul's jealousy (1 Sam. 18:6-16), which he showed in various
   ways. He conceived a bitter hatred toward him, and by various
   stratagems sought his death (1 Sam. 18-30). The deep-laid plots
   of the enraged king, who could not fail to observe that David
   "prospered exceedingly," all proved futile, and only endeared
   the young hero the more to the people, and very specially to
   Jonathan, Saul's son, between whom and David a life-long warm
   friendship was formed.
   
     A fugitive. To escape from the vengeance of Saul, David fled
   to Ramah (1 Sam. 19:12-18) to Samuel, who received him, and he
   dwelt among the sons of the prophets, who were there under
   Samuel's training. It is supposed by some that the sixth,
   seventh, and eleventh Psalms were composed by him at this time.
   This place was only 3 miles from the residence of Saul, who soon
   discovered whither the fugitive had gone, and tried
   ineffectually to bring him back. Jonathan made a fruitless
   effort to bring his father to a better state of mind toward
   David (1 Sam. 20), who, being made aware of the fact, saw no
   hope of safety but in flight to a distance. We accordingly find
   him first at Nob (21:1-9) and then at Gath, the chief city of
   the Philistines. The king of the Philistines would not admit him
   into his service, as he expected that he would, and David
   accordingly now betook himself to the stronghold of Adullam
   (22:1-4; 1 Chr. 12:8-18). Here in a short time 400 men gathered
   around him and acknowledged him as their leader. It was at this
   time that David, amid the harassment and perils of his position,
   cried, "Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well
   of Bethlehem;" when three of his heroes broke through the lines
   of the Philistines and brought him the water for which he longed
   (2 Sam. 23:13-17), but which he would not drink.
   
     In his rage at the failure of all his efforts to seize David,
   Saul gave orders for the massacre of the entire priestly family
   at Nob, "persons who wore a linen ephod", to the number of
   eighty-five persons, who were put to death by Doeg the Edomite.
   The sad tidings of the massacre were brought to David by
   Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech, the only one who escaped. Comp.
   Ps. 52.
   
     Hearing that Keilah, a town on the western frontier, was
   harassed by the Philistines, David with his men relieved it (1
   Sam. 23:1-14); and then, for fear of Saul, he fled to the
   strongholds in the "hill country" of Judah. Comp. Ps. 31. While
   encamped there, in the forest in the district of Ziph, he was
   visited by Jonathan, who spoke to him words of encouragement
   (23:16-18). The two now parted never to meet again. Saul
   continued his pursuit of David, who narrowly escaped from him at
   this time, and fled to the crags and ravines of Engedi, on the
   western shore of the Dead Sea (1 Sam. 23:29). Here Saul, who
   still pursued him with his army, narrowly escaped, through the
   generous forbearance of David, and was greatly affected by what
   David had done for him. He returned home from pursuing him, and
   David betook himself to Maon, where, with his 600 men, he
   maintained himself by contributions gathered from the district.
   Here occurred the incident connected with Nabal and his wife
   Abigail (1 Sam. 25), whom David married after Nabal's death.
   
     Saul again went forth (1 Sam. 26) in pursuit of David, who had
   hid himself "in the hill Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon," in
   the wilderness of Ziph, and was a second time spared through his
   forbearance. He returned home, professing shame and penitence
   for the way in which he had treated David, and predicting his
   elevation to the throne.
   
     Fighting against Israel. Harassed by the necessity of moving
   from place to place through fear of Saul, David once more sought
   refuge among the Philistines (1 Sam. 27). He was welcomed by the
   king, who assigned him Ziklag as his residence. Here David lived
   among his followers for some time as an independent chief
   engaged in frequent war with the Amalekites and other tribes on
   the south of Judah.
   
     Achish summoned David with his men to join his army against
   Saul; but the lords of the Philistines were suspicious of
   David's loyalty, and therefore he was sent back to Ziklag, which
   he found to his dismay may had been pillaged and burnt during
   his brief absence. David pursued after the raiders, the
   Amalekites, and completely routed them. On his return to Ziklag
   tidings reached him of Saul's death (2 Sam. 1). An Amalekite
   brought Saul's crown and bracelet and laid them at his feet.
   David and his men rent their clothes and mourned for Saul, who
   had been defeated in battle near Mount Gilboa. David composed a
   beautiful elegy, the most beautiful of all extant Hebrew odes, a
   "lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son" (2 Sam.
   1:18-27). It bore the title of "The Bow," and was to be taught
   to the children, that the memory of Saul and Jonathan might be
   preserved among them. "Behold, it is written in the book of
   Jasher" (q.v.).
   
     David king over Judah. David and his men now set out for
   Hebron under divine direction (2 Sam. 2:1-4). There they were
   cordially welcomed, and he was at once anointed as king. He was
   now about thirty years of age.
   
     But his title to the throne was not undisputed. Abner took
   Ish-bosheth, Saul's only remaining son, over the Jordan to
   Mahanaim, and there crowned him as king. Then began a civil war
   in Israel. The first encounter between the two opposing armies,
   led on the one side by Abner, and on the other by Joab, took
   place at the pool of Gibeon. It resulted in the defeat of Abner.
   Other encounters, however, between Israel and Judah followed (2
   Sam. 3:1, 5), but still success was on the side of David. For
   the space of seven and a half years David reigned in Hebron.
   Abner now sided with David, and sought to promote his
   advancement; but was treacherously put to death by Joab in
   revenge for his having slain his brother Asahel at Gibeon
   (3:22-39). This was greatly to David's regret. He mourned for
   the death of Abner. Shortly after this Ish-bosheth was also
   treacherously put to death by two Canaanites of Beeroth; and
   there being now no rival, David was anointed king over all
   Israel (4:1-12).
   
     David king over all Israel (2 Sam. 5:1-5; 1 Chr. 11:1-3). The
   elders of Israel now repaired to Hebron and offered allegiance
   to David in name of all the people, among whom the greatest
   enthusiasm prevailed. He was anointed king over all Israel, and
   sought out a new seat of government, more suitable than Hebron,
   as the capital of his empire. At this time there was a Jebusite
   fortress, "the stronghold", on the hill of Zion, called also
   Jebus. This David took from the Jebusites, and made it Israel's
   capital, and established here his residence, and afterwards
   built for himself a palace by the aid of Tyrian tradesmen. The
   Philistines, who had for some time observed a kind of truce, now
   made war against David; but were defeated in battle at a place
   afterwards called, in remembrance of the victory, Baal-perazim.
   Again they invaded the land, and were a second time routed by
   him. He thus delivered Israel from their enemies.
   
     David now resolved to bring up the ark of the covenant to his
   new capital (2 Sam. 6). It was in the house of Abinadab at
   Kirjath-jearim, about 7 miles from Jerusalem, where it had been
   for many years, from the time when the Philistines had sent it
   home (1 Sam. 6; 7). In consequence of the death of Uzzah (for it
   was a divine ordinance that only the Levites should handle the
   ark, Num. 4), who had put forth his hand to steady the ark when
   the cart in which it was being conveyed shook by reason of the
   roughness of the road, David stayed the procession, and conveyed
   the ark into the house of Obed-edom, a Philistine from Gath.
   After three months David brought the ark from the house of
   Obed-edom up to Jerusalem. Comp. Ps. 24. Here it was placed in a
   new tent or tabernacle which David erected for the purpose.
   About seventy years had passed since it had stood in the
   tabernacle at Shiloh. The old tabernacle was now at Gibeah, at
   which Zadok ministered. David now (1 Chr. 16) carefully set in
   order all the ritual of divine worship at Jerusalem, along with
   Abiathar the high priest. A new religious era began. The service
   of praise was for the first time introduced into public worship.
   Zion became henceforth "God's holy hill."
   
     David's wars. David now entered on a series of conquests which
   greatly extended and strengthened his kingdom (2 Sam. 8). In a
   few years the whole territory from the Euphrates to the river of
   Egypt, and from Gaza on the west to Thapsacus on the east, was
   under his sway (2 Sam. 8:3-13; 10).
   
     David's fall. He had now reached the height of his glory. He
   ruled over a vast empire, and his capital was enriched with the
   spoils of many lands. But in the midst of all this success he
   fell, and his character became stained with the sin of adultery
   (2 Sam. 11:2-27). It has been noted as characteristic of the
   Bible that while his military triumphs are recorded in a few
   verses, the sad story of his fall is given in detail, a story
   full of warning, and therefore recorded. This crime, in the
   attempt to conceal it, led to anoter. He was guilty of murder.
   Uriah, whom he had foully wronged, an officer of the Gibborim,
   the corps of heros (23:39), was, by his order, "set in the front
   of the hottest battle" at the siege of Rabbah, in order that he
   might be put to death. Nathan the prophet (2 Sam. 7:1-17;
   12:1-23) was sent by God to bring home his crimes to the
   conscience of the guilty monarch. He became a true penitent. He
   bitterly bewailed his sins before God. The thirty-second and
   fifty-first Psalms reveal the deep struggles of his soul, and
   his spiritual recovery.
   
     Bathsheba became his wife after Uriah's death. Her first-born
   son died, according to the word of the prophet. She gave birth
   to a second son, whom David called Solomon, and who ultimately
   succeeded him on the throne (2 Sam. 12:24, 25).
   
     Peace. After the successful termination of all his wars, David
   formed the idea of building a temple for the ark of God. This he
   was not permitted to carry into execution, because he had been a
   man of war. God, however, sent Nathan to him with a gracious
   message (2 Sam. 7:1-16). On receiving it he went into the
   sanctuary, the tent where the ark was, and sat before the Lord,
   and poured out his heart in words of devout thanksgiving
   (18-29). The building of the temple was reserved for his son
   Solomon, who would be a man of peace (1 Chr. 22:9; 28:3).
   
     A cloudy evening. Hitherto David's carrer had been one of
   great prosperity and success. Now cloudy and dark days came. His
   eldest son Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam of Jezreel, was
   guilty of a great and shameful crime (2 Sam. 13). This was the
   beginning of the disasters of his later years. After two years
   Absalom terribly avenged the crime against Tamar, and put Amnon
   to death. This brought sore trouble to David's heart. Absalom,
   afraid of the consequences of his guilt, fled to Geshur beyond
   Jordan, where he remained for three years, when he was brought
   back through the intrigue of Joab (2 Sam. 14).
   
     After this there fell upon the land the calamity of three
   years' famine (2 Sam. 21:1-14). This was soon after followed by
   a pestilence, brought upon the land as a punishment for David's
   sinful pride in numbering the people (2 Sam. 24), in which no
   fewer than 70,000 perished in the space of three days.
   
     Rebellion of Absalom. The personal respect for David was sadly
   lowered by the incident of Bathsheba. There was a strong popular
   sentiment against the taking of the census, and the outburst of
   the plague in connection with it deepened the feeling of
   jealously that had begun to manifest itself among some of the
   tribes against David. Absalom, taking full advantage of this
   state of things, gradually gained over the people, and at length
   openly rebelled against his father, and usurped the throne.
   Ahithophel was Absalom's chief counsellor. The revolt began in
   Hebron, the capital of Judah. Absalom was there proclaimed king.
   David was now in imminent danger, and he left Jerusalem (2 Sam.
   15:13-20), and once more became a fugitive. It was a momentous
   day in Israel. The incidents of it are recorded with a fulness
   of detail greater than of any other day in Old Testament
   history. David fled with his followers to Mahanarm, on the east
   of Jordan. An unnatural civil war broke out. After a few weeks
   the rival armies were mustered and organized. They met in
   hostile array at the wood of Ephraim (2 Sam. 18:1-8). Absalom's
   army was defeated, and himself put to death by the hand of Joab
   (9-18). The tidings of the death of his rebellious son filled
   the heart of David with the most poignant grief. He "went up to
   the chamber over the gate, and wept" (33), giving utterance to
   the heart-broken cry, "Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom,
   my son, my son!" Peace was now restored, and David returned to
   Jerusalem and resumed the direction of affairs. An unhappy
   dispute arose between the men of Judah and the men of Israel
   (19:41-43). Sheba, a Benjamite, headed a revolt of the men of
   Israel. He was pursued to Abelbeth-maachah, and was there put to
   death, and so the revolt came to an end.
   
     The end. After the suppression of the rebellion of Absalom and
   that of Sheba, ten comparatively peaceful years of David's life
   passed away. During those years he seems to have been
   principally engaged in accumulating treasures of every kind for
   the great temple at Jerusalem, which it was reserved to his
   successor to build (1 Chr. 22; 28; 29), a house which was to be
   "exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all
   countries" (22:5). The exciting and laborious life he had spent,
   and the dangers and trials through which he had passed, had left
   him an enfeebled man, prematurely old. It became apparent that
   his life was now drawing to its close. A new palace conspiracy
   broke out as to who should be his successor. Joab favoured
   Adonijah. The chiefs of his party met at the "Fuller's spring,"
   in the valley of Kidron, to proclaim him king; but Nathan
   hastened on a decision on the part of David in favour of
   Solomon, and so the aim of Adonijah's party failed. Solomon was
   brought to Jerusalem, and was anointed king and seated on his
   father's throne (1 Kings 1:11-53). David's last words are a
   grand utterance, revealing his unfailing faith in God, and his
   joyful confidence in his gracious covenant promises (2 Sam.
   23:1-7).
   
     After a reign of forty years and six months (2 Sam. 5:5; 1
   Chr. 3:4) David died (B.C. 1015) at the age of seventy years,
   "and was buried in the city of David." His tomb is still pointed
   out on Mount Zion.
   
     Both in his prophetical and in his regal character David was a
   type of the Messiah (1 Sam. 16:13). The book of Psalms commonly
   bears the title of the "Psalms of David," from the circumstance
   that he was the largest contributor (about eighty psalms) to the
   collection. (See {PSALMS}.)
   
     "The greatness of David was felt when he was gone. He had
   lived in harmony with both the priesthood and the prophets; a
   sure sign that the spirit of his government had been throughly
   loyal to the higher aims of the theocracy. The nation had not
   been oppressed by him, but had been left in the free enjoyment
   of its ancient liberties. As far as his power went he had
   striven to act justly to all (2 Sam. 8:15). His weak indulgence
   to his sons, and his own great sin besides, had been bitterly
   atoned, and were forgotten at his death in the remembrance of
   his long-tried worth. He had reigned thirty-three years in
   Jerusalem and seven and a half at Hebron (2 Sam. 5:5). Israel at
   his accession had reached the lowest point of national
   depression; its new-born unity rudely dissolved; its territory
   assailed by the Philistines. But he had left it an imperial
   power, with dominions like those of Egypt or Assyria. The
   sceptre of Solomon was already, before his father's death, owned
   from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, and from the Orontes to
   the Red Sea.", Geikie's Hours etc., iii.
