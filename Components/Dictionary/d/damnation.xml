      <WordDefinition>Damnation
   in Rom. 13:2, means "condemnation," which comes on those who
   withstand God's ordinance of magistracy. This sentence of
   condemnation comes not from the magistrate, but from God, whose
   authority is thus resisted.
   
     In 1 Cor. 11:29 (R.V., "judgment") this word means
   condemnation, in the sense of exposure to severe temporal
   judgements from God, as the following verse explains.
   
     In Rom. 14:23 the word "damned" means "condemned" by one's own
   conscience, as well as by the Word of God. The apostle shows
   here that many things which are lawful are not expedient; and
   that in using our Christian liberty the question should not
   simply be, Is this course I follow lawful? but also, Can I
   follow it without doing injury to the spiritual interests of a
   brother in Christ? He that "doubteth", i.e., is not clear in his
   conscience as to "meats", will violate his conscience "if he
   eat," and in eating is condemned; and thus one ought not so to
   use his liberty as to lead one who is "weak" to bring upon
   himself this condemnation.
