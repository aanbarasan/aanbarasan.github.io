   Usage: Delicious refers to the pleasure derived from certain
          of the senses, particularly the taste and smell; as,

          also refer to most of the senses (as, delightful
          music; a delightful prospect; delightful sensations),
          but has a higher application to matters of taste,
          feeling, and sentiment; as, a delightful abode,
          conversation, employment; delightful scenes, etc.
          [1913 Webster]
