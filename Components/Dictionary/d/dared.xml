   Note: The present tense, I dare, is really an old past tense,
         so that the third person is he dare, but the form he
         dares is now often used, and will probably displace the
         obsolescent he dare, through grammatically as incorrect
         as he shalls or he cans. --Skeat.

         [1913 Webster]

   Note: Formerly durst was also used as the present. Sometimes
         the old form dare is found for durst or dared.
