      <WordDefinition>Dynamic \Dy*nam"ic\, Dynamical \Dy*nam"ic*al\, a. [Gr. ?
   powerful, fr. ? power, fr. ? to be able; cf. L. durus hard,
   E. dure: cf. F. dynamique.]
   1. Of or pertaining to dynamics; belonging to energy or
      power; characterized by energy or production of force.
      [1913 Webster]

            Science, as well as history, has its past to show,
            -- a past indeed, much larger; but its immensity is
            dynamic, not divine.                  --J.
                                                  Martineau.
      [1913 Webster]

            The vowel is produced by phonetic, not by dynamic,
            causes.                               --J. Peile.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Relating to physical forces, effects, or laws; as,
      dynamical geology.
      [1913 Webster]

            As natural science has become more dynamic, so has
            history.                              --Prof. Shedd.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Dynamical electricity}. See under {Electricity}.
