      <WordDefinition>digital
     
        &lt;data&gt; A description of {data} which is stored or transmitted
        as a sequence of discrete symbols from a finite set, most
        commonly this means {binary} data represented using electronic
        or electromagnetic signals.
     
        The opposite is {analogue}.

      <WordDefinition>digital \dig"i*tal\ (d[i^]j"[i^]*tal), a. [L. digitals.]
   1. Of or pertaining to the fingers; done with the fingers;
      as, digital compression; digital examination.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. of or pertaining to digits[3]; expressed in digits[3], or
      using digits[3]; as, a digital display; a digital clock.
      [PJC]

   3. (Computers) performing internal logical and arithmetic
      operations by means of digits, usually represented as
      binary numbers. Contrasted to {analog}, wherein variables
      are represented as coninuous physical quantities such as
      voltages or the position of a pointer on a continuous
      scale; as, a digital computer.
      [PJC]

   Note: In digital computers, physical quantities in analog
         form, such as images, sounds, distances, voltages,
         etc., must first be converted to an internal digital
         representation before calculations can be performed on
         them. The conversion may be done by the data enterer,
         by approximation, in the case of numerical values, or
         by analog-to-digital conversion in the case of light or
         sound intensities. The latter case uses special
         equipment to convert the physical impulses into a
         digital value, using a pre-defined encoding system.
