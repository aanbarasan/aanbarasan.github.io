      <WordDefinition>Dream
   God has frequently made use of dreams in communicating his will
   to men. The most remarkable instances of this are recorded in
   the history of Jacob (Gen. 28:12; 31:10), Laban (31:24), Joseph
   (37:9-11), Gideon (Judg. 7), and Solomon (1 Kings 3:5). Other
   significant dreams are also recorded, such as those of Abimelech
   (Gen. 20:3-7), Pharaoh's chief butler and baker (40:5), Pharaoh
   (41:1-8), the Midianites (Judg. 7:13), Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 2:1;
   4:10, 18), the wise men from the east (Matt. 2:12), and Pilate's
   wife (27:19).
   
     To Joseph "the Lord appeared in a dream," and gave him
   instructions regarding the infant Jesus (Matt. 1:20; 2:12, 13,
   19). In a vision of the night a "man of Macedonia" stood before
   Paul and said, "Come over into Macedonia and help us" (Acts
   16:9; see also 18:9; 27:23).
