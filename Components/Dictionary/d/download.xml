        &lt;jargon&gt; To transfer data or (especially) code from one
        computer to another.  The distinction between downloading and
        uploading is hazy but downloading often refers to transfer
        from a larger "host" system (especially a {server} or
        {mainframe}) to a smaller "client" system, especially a
        {microcomputer} or specialised peripheral.
     
        Opposite: {upload}.
     
        However, note that ground-to-space communications has its own
        usage rule for this term.  Space-to-earth transmission is
        always "down" and the reverse "up" regardless of the relative
        size of the computers involved.  So far the in-space machines
        have invariably been smaller; thus the upload/download
        distinction has been reversed from its usual sense.

      <WordDefinition>download vt. To transfer data or (esp.) code from a far-away system
   (especially a larger `host' system) over a digital communications link
   to a nearby system (especially a smaller `client' system. Oppose
   {upload}.

   Historical use of these terms was at one time associated with
   transfers from large timesharing machines to PCs or peripherals
   (download) and vice-versa (upload). The modern usage relative to the
   speaker (rather than as an indicator of the size and role of the
   machines) evolved as machine categories lost most of their former
   functional importance.
