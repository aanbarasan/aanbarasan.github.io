      <WordDefinition>Doors
   moved on pivots of wood fastened in sockets above and below
   (Prov. 26:14). They were fastened by a lock (Judg. 3:23, 25;
   Cant. 5:5) or by a bar (Judg. 16:3; Job 38:10). In the interior
   of Oriental houses, curtains were frequently used instead of
   doors.
   
     The entrances of the tabernacle had curtains (Ex. 26:31-33,
   36). The "valley of Achor" is called a "door of hope," because
   immediately after the execution of Achan the Lord said to
   Joshua, "Fear not," and from that time Joshua went forward in a
   career of uninterrupted conquest. Paul speaks of a "door opened"
   for the spread of the gospel (1 Cor. 16:9; 2 Cor. 2:12; Col.
   4:3). Our Lord says of himself, "I am the door" (John 10:9).
   John (Rev. 4:1) speaks of a "door opened in heaven."
