         navigation is not measured from the beginning nor from
         the end of the ship's course, but is regarded as the
         total easting or westing made by the ship or person as
         he travels over the course.

   {To take a departure} (Nav. &amp; Surv.), to ascertain, usually
      by taking bearings from a landmark, the position of a
      vessel at the beginning of a voyage as a point from which
      to begin her dead reckoning; as, the ship took her
      departure from Sandy Hook.

   Syn: Death; demise; release. See {Death}.
