      <WordDefinition>Divorce
   The dissolution of the marriage tie was regulated by the Mosaic
   law (Deut. 24:1-4). The Jews, after the Captivity, were reguired
   to dismiss the foreign women they had married contrary to the
   law (Ezra 10:11-19). Christ limited the permission of divorce to
   the single case of adultery. It seems that it was not uncommon
   for the Jews at that time to dissolve the union on very slight
   pretences (Matt. 5:31, 32; 19:1-9; Mark 10:2-12; Luke 16:18).
   These precepts given by Christ regulate the law of divorce in
   the Christian Church.
