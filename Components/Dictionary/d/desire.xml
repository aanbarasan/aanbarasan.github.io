   Syn: To long for; hanker after; covet; wish; ask; request;
        solicit; entreat; beg.

   Usage: To {Desire}, {Wish}. In desire the feeling is usually
          more eager than in wish. ``I wish you to do this'' is
          a milder form of command than ``I desire you to do
          this,'' though the feeling prompting the injunction
          may be the same. --C. J. Smith.
