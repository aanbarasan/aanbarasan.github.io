      <WordDefinition>Dove
   In their wild state doves generally build their nests in the
   clefts of rocks, but when domesticated "dove-cots" are prepared
   for them (Cant. 2:14; Jer. 48:28; Isa. 60:8). The dove was
   placed on the standards of the Assyrians and Babylonians in
   honour, it is supposed, of Semiramis (Jer. 25:38; Vulg.,
   "fierceness of the dove;" comp. Jer. 46:16; 50:16). Doves and
   turtle-doves were the only birds that could be offered in
   sacrifice, as they were clean according to the Mosaic law (Ge.
   15:9; Lev. 5:7; 12:6; Luke 2:24). The dove was the harbinger of
   peace to Noah (Gen. 8:8, 10). It is often mentioned as the
   emblem of purity (Ps. 68:13). It is a symbol of the Holy Spirit
   (Gen. 1:2; Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32); also of
   tender and devoted affection (Cant. 1:15; 2:14). David in his
   distress wished that he had the wings of a dove, that he might
   fly away and be at rest (Ps. 55:6-8). There is a species of dove
   found at Damascus "whose feathers, all except the wings, are
   literally as yellow as gold" (68:13).

      <WordDefinition>Dove \Dove\ (d[u^]v), n. [OE. dove, duve, douve, AS. d[=u]fe;
   akin to OS. d[=u]ba, D. duif, OHG. t[=u]ba, G. taube, Icel.
   d[=u]fa, Sw. dufva, Dan. due, Goth. d[=u]b[=o]; perh. from
   the root of E. dive.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) A pigeon of the genus {Columba} and various
      related genera. The species are numerous.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The domestic dove, including the varieties called
         {fantails}, {tumblers}, {carrier pigeons}, etc., was
         derived from the {rock pigeon} ({Columba livia}) of
         Europe and Asia; the {turtledove} of Europe, celebrated
         for its sweet, plaintive note, is {Columba turtur} or
         {Turtur vulgaris}; the {ringdove}, the largest of
         European species, is {Columba palumbus}; the {Carolina
         dove}, or {Mourning dove}, is {Zenaidura macroura}; the
         {sea dove} is the little auk ({Mergulus alle} or {Alle
         alle}). See {Turtledove}, {Ground dove}, and {Rock
         pigeon}. The dove is a symbol of peace, innocence,
         gentleness, and affection; also, in art and in the
         Scriptures, the typical symbol of the Holy Ghost.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. A word of endearment for one regarded as pure and gentle.
      [1913 Webster]
