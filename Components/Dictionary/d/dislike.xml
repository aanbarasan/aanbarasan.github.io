        {Dislike}, {Aversion}, {Reluctance}, {Repugnance},
        {Disgust}, {Antipathy}. Dislike is the more general
        term, applicable to both persons and things and arising
        either from feeling or judgment. It may mean little more
        than want of positive liking; but antipathy, repugnance,
        disgust, and aversion are more intense phases of
        dislike. Aversion denotes a fixed and habitual dislike;
        as, an aversion to or for business. Reluctance and
        repugnance denote a mental strife or hostility something
        proposed (repugnance being the stronger); as, a
        reluctance to make the necessary sacrifices, and a
        repugnance to the submission required. Disgust is
        repugnance either of taste or moral feeling; as, a
        disgust at gross exhibitions of selfishness. Antipathy
        is primarily an instinctive feeling of dislike of a
        thing, such as most persons feel for a snake. When used
        figuratively, it denotes a correspondent dislike for
        certain persons, modes of acting, etc. Men have an
        aversion to what breaks in upon their habits; a
        reluctance and repugnance to what crosses their will; a
        disgust at what offends their sensibilities; and are
        often governed by antipathies for which they can give no
        good reason.
