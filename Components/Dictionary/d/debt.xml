      <WordDefinition>DEBT, n.  An ingenious substitute for the chain and whip of the slave-
driver.

    As, pent in an aquarium, the troutlet
    Swims round and round his tank to find an outlet,
    Pressing his nose against the glass that holds him,
    Nor ever sees the prison that enfolds him;
    So the poor debtor, seeing naught around him,
    Yet feels the narrow limits that impound him,
    Grieves at his debt and studies to evade it,
    And finds at last he might as well have paid it.
                                                        Barlow S. Vode

      <WordDefinition>Debt
   The Mosaic law encouraged the practice of lending (Deut. 15:7;
   Ps. 37:26; Matt. 5:42); but it forbade the exaction of interest
   except from foreigners. Usury was strongly condemned (Prov.
   28:8; Ezek. 18:8, 13, 17; 22:12; Ps. 15:5). On the Sabbatical
   year all pecuniary obligations were cancelled (Deut. 15:1-11).
   These regulations prevented the accumulation of debt.
