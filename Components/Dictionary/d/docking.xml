      <WordDefinition>docking \docking\ n.
   1. (Naut.) a act of securing an arriving vessel with ropes or
      anchors.

   Syn: mooring, tying up, dropping anchor.
        [WordNet 1.5]

   2. (Astronautics) the coming together and joining of two
      space vehicles. The joining usually is accomplished by
      bringing special connecting devices, the docking ports,
      into contact, and fastening the ships together by clamping
      devices. The docking ports are often fitted so as to allow
      a passage to be opened between the two space vehciles, and
      thus to permit transfer of materials or personnel between
      them.
