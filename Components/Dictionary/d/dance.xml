      <WordDefinition>DANCE, v.i.  To leap about to the sound of tittering music, preferably
with arms about your neighbor's wife or daughter.  There are many
kinds of dances, but all those requiring the participation of the two
sexes have two characteristics in common:  they are conspicuously
innocent, and warmly loved by the vicious.

   found in Judg. 21:21, 23; Ps. 30:11; 149:3; 150:4; Jer. 31:4,
   13, etc., as the translation of _hul_, which points to the
   whirling motion of Oriental sacred dances. It is the rendering
   of a word (rakad') which means to skip or leap for joy, in Eccl.
   3:4; Job 21:11; Isa. 13:21, etc.
   
     In the New Testament it is in like manner the translation of
   different Greek words, circular motion (Luke 15:25); leaping up
   and down in concert (Matt. 11:17), and by a single person (Matt.
   14:6).
   
     It is spoken of as symbolical of rejoicing (Eccl. 3:4. Comp.
   Ps. 30:11; Matt. 11: 17). The Hebrews had their sacred dances
   expressive of joy and thanksgiving, when the performers were
   usually females (Ex. 15:20; 1 Sam. 18:6).
   
     The ancient dance was very different from that common among
   Western nations. It was usually the part of the women only (Ex.
   15:20; Judg. 11:34; comp. 5:1). Hence the peculiarity of David's
   conduct in dancing before the ark of the Lord (2 Sam. 6:14). The
   women took part in it with their timbrels. Michal should, in
   accordance with the example of Miriam and others, have herself
   led the female choir, instead of keeping aloof on the occasion
   and "looking through the window." David led the choir
   "uncovered", i.e., wearing only the ephod or linen tunic. He
   thought only of the honour of God, and forgot himself.
   
     From being reserved for occasions of religious worship and
   festivity, it came gradually to be practised in common life on
   occasions of rejoicing (Jer. 31:4). The sexes among the Jews
   always danced separately. The daughter of Herodias danced alone
   (Matt. 14:6).
