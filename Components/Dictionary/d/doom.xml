      <WordDefinition>DOOM
     
        &lt;games&gt; A simulated 3D moster-hunting action game for {IBM
        PC}s, created and published by {id Software}.  The original
        press release was dated January 1993.  A cut-down shareware
        version v1.0 was released on 10 December 1993 and again with
        some bug-fixes, as v1.4 in June 1994.
     
        DOOM is similar to Wolfenstein 3d (id Software, Apogee) but
        has better {texture mapping}; walls can be at any angle, of
        any thickness and have windows; lighting can fade into the
        distance or come from point sources; floors and ceilings can
        be of any height; many surfaces are animated; up to four
        players can play over a network or two by serial link; it has
        a high {frame rate} (comparable to TV on a {486}/33); DOOM
        isn't just a collection of connected closed rooms like
        Wolfenstein but sounds can travel anywhere and alert monsters
        of your approach.
