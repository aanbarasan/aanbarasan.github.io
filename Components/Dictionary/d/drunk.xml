      <WordDefinition>Drunk
   The first case of intoxication on record is that of Noah (Gen.
   9:21). The sin of drunkenness is frequently and strongly
   condemned (Rom. 13:13; 1 Cor. 6:9, 10; Eph. 5:18; 1 Thess. 5:7,
   8). The sin of drinking to excess seems to have been not
   uncommon among the Israelites.
   
     The word is used figuratively, when men are spoken of as being
   drunk with sorrow, and with the wine of God's wrath (Isa. 63:6;
   Jer. 51:57; Ezek. 23:33). To "add drunkenness to thirst" (Deut.
   29:19, A.V.) is a proverbial expression, rendered in the Revised
   Version "to destroy the moist with the dry", i.e., the
   well-watered equally with the dry land, meaning that the effect
   of such walking in the imagination of their own hearts would be
   to destroy one and all.
