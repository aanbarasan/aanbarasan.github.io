      <WordDefinition>Diamond
   (1.) A precious gem (Heb. yahalom', in allusion to its
   hardness), otherwise unknown, the sixth, i.e., the third in the
   second row, in the breastplate of the high priest, with the name
   of Naphtali engraven on it (Ex. 28:18; 39:11; R.V. marg.,
   "sardonyx.")
   
     (2.) A precious stone (Heb. shamir', a sharp point) mentioned
   in Jer. 17:1. From its hardness it was used for cutting and
   perforating other minerals. It is rendered "adamant" (q.v.) in
   Ezek. 3:9, Zech. 7:12. It is the hardest and most valuable of
   precious stones.

      <WordDefinition>Diamond \Di"a*mond\ (?; 277), n. [OE. diamaund, diamaunt, F.
   diamant, corrupted, fr. L. adamas, the hardest iron, steel,
   diamond, Gr. ?. Perh. the corruption is due to the influence

   1. A precious stone or gem excelling in brilliancy and
      beautiful play of prismatic colors, and remarkable for

   Note: The diamond is native carbon in isometric crystals,
         often octahedrons with rounded edges. It is usually
         colorless, but some are yellow, green, blue, and even
         black. It is the hardest substance known. The diamond
         as found in nature (called a rough diamond) is cut, for
         use in jewelry, into various forms with many reflecting
         faces, or facets, by which its brilliancy is much
         increased. See {Brilliant}, {Rose}. Diamonds are said
         to be of the first water when very transparent, and of
         the second or third water as the transparency
         decreases.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. A geometrical figure, consisting of four equal straight

      a diamond.

      side, having the bases at its angles.
      [1913 Webster]

      except that called brilliant, which is seldom seen.
