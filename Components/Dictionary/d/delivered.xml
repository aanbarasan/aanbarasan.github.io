   Syn: To {Deliver}, {Give Forth}, {Discharge}, {Liberate},
        {Pronounce}, {Utter}.

   Usage: Deliver denotes, literally, to set free. Hence the
          term is extensively applied to cases where a thing is
          made to pass from a confined state to one of greater
          freedom or openness. Hence it may, in certain
          connections, be used as synonymous with any or all of
          the above-mentioned words, as will be seen from the
          following examples: One who delivers a package gives
          it forth; one who delivers a cargo discharges it; one
          who delivers a captive liberates him; one who delivers
          a message or a discourse utters or pronounces it; when
          soldiers deliver their fire, they set it free or give
          it forth.
          [1913 Webster]
