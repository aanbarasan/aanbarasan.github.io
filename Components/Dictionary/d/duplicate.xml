   {Duplicate proportion} or {Duplicate ratio} (Math.), the
      proportion or ratio of squares. Thus, in geometrical
      proportion, the first term to the third is said to be in a
      duplicate ratio of the first to the second, or as its
      square is to the square of the second. Thus, in 2, 4, 8,
      16, the ratio of 2 to 8 is a duplicate of that of 2 to 4,
      or as the square of 2 is to the square of 4.
