      <WordDefinition>Daughter
   This word, besides its natural and proper sense, is used to
   designate, (1.) A niece or any female descendant (Gen. 20:12;
   24:48; 28:6). (2.) Women as natives of a place, or as professing
   the religion of a place; as, "the daughters of Zion" (Isa.
   3:16), "daughters of the Philistines" (2 Sam. 1:20). (3.) Small
   towns and villages lying around a city are its "daughters," as
   related to the metropolis or mother city. Tyre is in this sense
   called the daughter of Sidon (Isa. 23:12). (4.) The people of
   Jerusalem are spoken of as "the daughters of Zion" (Isa. 37:22).
   (5.) The daughters of a tree are its boughs (Gen. 49:22). (6.)
   The "daughters of music" (Eccl. 12:4) are singing women.
