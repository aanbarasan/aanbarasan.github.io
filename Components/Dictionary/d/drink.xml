      <WordDefinition>Drink
   The drinks of the Hebrews were water, wine, "strong drink," and
   vinegar. Their drinking vessels were the cup, goblet or "basin,"
   the "cruse" or pitcher, and the saucer.
   
     To drink water by measure (Ezek. 4:11), and to buy water to
   drink (Lam. 5:4), denote great scarcity. To drink blood means to
   be satiated with slaughter.
   
     The Jews carefully strained their drinks through a sieve,
   through fear of violating the law of Lev. 11:20, 23, 41, 42.
   (See Matt. 23:24. "Strain at" should be "strain out.")
