      <WordDefinition>Deride \De*ride"\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Derided}; p. pr. &amp; vb.
   n. {Deriding}.] [L. deridere, derisum; de- + rid?re to laugh.
   See {Ridicule}.]
   To laugh at with contempt; to laugh to scorn; to turn to
   ridicule or make sport of; to mock; to scoff at.
   [1913 Webster]

         And the Pharisees, also, . . . derided him. --Luke xvi.
                                                  14.
   [1913 Webster]

         Sport that wrinkled Care derides.
         And Laughter holding both his sides.     --Milton.

   Syn: To mock; laugh at; ridicule; insult; taunt; jeer;
        banter; rally.

   Usage: To {Deride}, {Ridicule}, {Mock}, {Taunt}. A man may
          ridicule without any unkindness of feeling; his object
          may be to correct; as, to ridicule the follies of the
          age. He who derides is actuated by a severe a
          contemptuous spirit; as, to deride one for his
          religious principles. To mock is stronger, and denotes
          open and scornful derision; as, to mock at sin. To
          taunt is to reproach with the keenest insult; as, to
          taunt one for his misfortunes. Ridicule consists more
          in words than in actions; derision and mockery evince
          themselves in actions as well as words; taunts are
          always expressed in words of extreme bitterness.
          [1913 Webster]
