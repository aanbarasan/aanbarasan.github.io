      <WordDefinition>Dengue \Den"gue\ (d[e^][ng]"g[asl]), n. [See Note, below.]
   (Med.)
   A specific epidemic disease attended with high fever,
   cutaneous eruption, and severe pains in the head and limbs,
   resembling those of rheumatism; -- called also {breakbone
   fever}. It occurs in India, Egypt, the West Indies, etc., is
   of short duration, and rarely fatal.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: This disease, when it first appeared in the British
         West India Islands, was called the dandy fever, from
         the stiffness and constraint which it grave to the
         limbs and body. The Spaniards of the neighboring
         islands mistook the term for their word dengue,
         denoting prudery, which might also well express
         stiffness, and hence the term dengue became, as last,
         the name of the disease. --Tully.
         [1913 Webster]
