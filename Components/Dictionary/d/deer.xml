   unknown origin. [root]71.]

   2. (Zo["o]l.) A ruminant of the genus {Cervus}, of many
      species, and of related genera of the family {Cervid[ae]}.
      The males, and in some species the females, have solid
      antlers, often much branched, which are shed annually.
      Their flesh, for which they are hunted, is called
      {venison}.

   Note: The deer hunted in England is {Cervus elaphus}, called
         also stag or {red deer}; the fallow deer is {Cervus
         dama}; the common American deer is {Cervus
         Virginianus}; the blacktailed deer of Western North
         America is {Cervus Columbianus}; and the mule deer of
         the same region is {Cervus macrotis}. See {Axis},
         {Fallow deer}, {Mule deer}, {Reindeer}.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: Deer is much used adjectively, or as the first part of
         a compound; as, deerkiller, deerslayer, deerslaying,
         deer hunting, deer stealing, deerlike, etc.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Deer mouse} (Zo["o]l.), the white-footed mouse ({Peromyscus
      leucopus}, formerly {Hesperomys leucopus}) of America.

   {Small deer}, petty game, not worth pursuing; -- used
      metaphorically. (See citation from Shakespeare under the
      first definition, above.) ``Minor critics . . . can find
      leisure for the chase of such small deer.'' --G. P. Marsh.
