        1. &lt;hardware&gt; {monitor}.
     
        2. &lt;language&gt; A vector of pointers to {activation record}s.
        The Nth element points to the activation record containing
        variables declared at {lexical depth} N.  This allows faster
        access to variables from outer {scope}s than the alternative
        of linked activation records (but most variable accesses are
        either local or global or occasionally to the immediately
        enclosing scope).  Displays were used in some {ALGOL}
        implementations.
