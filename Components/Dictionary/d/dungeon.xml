      <WordDefinition>Dungeon
   different from the ordinary prison in being more severe as a
   place of punishment. Like the Roman inner prison (Acts 16:24),
   it consisted of a deep cell or cistern (Jer. 38:6). To be shut
   up in, a punishment common in Egypt (Gen. 39:20; 40:3; 41:10;
   42:19). It is not mentioned, however, in the law of Moses as a
   mode of punishment. Under the later kings imprisonment was
   frequently used as a punishment (2 Chron. 16:10; Jer. 20:2;
   32:2; 33:1; 37:15), and it was customary after the Exile (Matt.
   11:2; Luke 3:20; Acts 5:18, 21; Matt. 18:30).
