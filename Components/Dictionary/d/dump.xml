      <WordDefinition>dump
     
        &lt;operating system&gt; 1. An undigested and voluminous mass of
        information about a problem or the state of a system,
        especially one routed to the slowest available output device
        (compare {core dump}), and most especially one consisting of
        {hexadecimal} or {octal} {runes} describing the byte-by-byte
        state of memory, mass storage, or some file.  In {elder days},
        debugging was generally done by "groveling over" a dump (see
        {grovel}); increasing use of high-level languages and
        interactive debuggers has made such tedium uncommon, and the
        term "dump" now has a faintly archaic flavour.
     
        2. A {backup}.  This usage is typical only at large
        {time-sharing} installations.
     
        {Unix manual page}: dump(1).
