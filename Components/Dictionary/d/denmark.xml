   Introduction Denmark
   --------------------
                            Background: Once the seat of Viking raiders and
                                        later a major north European power,
                                        Denmark has evolved into a modern,
                                        prosperous nation that is
                                        participating in the general
                                        political and economic integration
                                        of Europe. However, the country has
                                        opted out of European Union's
                                        Maastricht Treaty, the European
                                        monetary system (EMU), and issues
                                        concerning certain internal affairs.
