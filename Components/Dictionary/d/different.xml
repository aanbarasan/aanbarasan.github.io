      <WordDefinition>Different \Dif"fer*ent\, a. [L. differens, -entis, p. pr. of
   differre: cf. F. diff['e]rent.]
   1. Distinct; separate; not the same; other. ``Five different
      churches.'' --Addison.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Of various or contrary nature, form, or quality; partially
      or totally unlike; dissimilar; as, different kinds of food
      or drink; different states of health; different shapes;
      different degrees of excellence.
      [1913 Webster]

            Men are as different from each other, as the regions
            in which they are born are different. --Dryden.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Different is properly followed by from. Different to,
         for different from, is a common English colloquialism.
         Different than is quite inadmissible.
         [1913 Webster]
