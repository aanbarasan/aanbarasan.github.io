   degradare. See {Degrade}.]
   1. A step, stair, or staircase. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

   5. Grade or rank to which scholars are admitted by a college

      (informal) the diploma provided by an educational
      institution attesting to the achievement of that rank; as,
      the degree of bachelor of arts, master, doctor, etc.; to
      hang one's degrees on the office wall.
      [1913 Webster +PJC]

   Note: In the United States diplomas are usually given as the
         evidence of a degree conferred. In the humanities the
         first degree is that of {bachelor of arts} (B. A. or A.
         B.); the second that of {master of arts} (M. A. or A.
         M.). The degree of bachelor (of arts, science,
         divinity, law, etc.) is conferred upon those who
         complete a prescribed course of undergraduate study.
         The first degree in medicine is that of {doctor of
         medicine} (M. D.). The degrees of master and doctor are
         also conferred, in course, upon those who have
         completed certain prescribed postgraduate studies, as
         {doctor of philosophy} (Ph. D.); the degree of doctor
         is also conferred as a complimentary recognition of
         eminent services in science or letters, or for public
         services or distinction (as {doctor of laws} (LL. D.)
         or {doctor of divinity} (D. D.), when they are called
         {honorary degrees}.
         [1913 Webster]

               The youth attained his bachelor's degree, and

         [1913 Webster]

   6. (Genealogy) A certain distance or remove in the line of
      descent, determining the proximity of blood; one remove in
      the chain of relationship; as, a relation in the third or
      fourth degree.
      [1913 Webster]

            In the 11th century an opinion began to gain ground
            in Italy, that third cousins might marry, being in
            the seventh degree according to the civil law.
                                                  --Hallam.
      [1913 Webster]

   7. (Arith.) Three figures taken together in numeration; thus,
      140 is one degree, 222,140 two degrees.
      [1913 Webster]

   8. (Algebra) State as indicated by sum of exponents; more
      particularly, the degree of a term is indicated by the sum
      of the exponents of its literal factors; thus, a^{2}b^{3}c
      is a term of the sixth degree. The degree of a power, or
      radical, is denoted by its index, that of an equation by
      the greatest sum of the exponents of the unknown
      quantities in any term; thus, ax^{4} + bx^{2} = c, and
      mx^{2}y^{2} + nyx = p, are both equations of the fourth
      degree.
      [1913 Webster]

   9. (Trig.) A 360th part of the circumference of a circle,
      which part is taken as the principal unit of measure for
      arcs and angles. The degree is divided into 60 minutes and
      the minute into 60 seconds.
      [1913 Webster]

   10. A division, space, or interval, marked on a mathematical
       or other instrument, as on a thermometer.

   11. (Mus.) A line or space of the staff.

         [1913 Webster]

   {Accumulation of degrees}. (Eng. Univ.) See under
      {Accumulation}.

   {By degrees}, step by step; by little and little; by moderate
      advances. ``I'll leave it by degrees.'' --Shak.

   {Degree of a curve} or {Degree of a surface} (Geom.), the
      number which expresses the degree of the equation of the
      curve or surface in rectilinear co["o]rdinates. A straight
      line will, in general, meet the curve or surface in a
      number of points equal to the degree of the curve or
      surface and no more.

   {Degree of latitude} (Geog.), on the earth, the distance on a
      meridian between two parallels of latitude whose latitudes
      differ from each other by one degree. This distance is not
      the same on different parts of a meridian, on account of
      the flattened figure of the earth, being 68.702 statute
      miles at the equator, and 69.396 at the poles.

   {Degree of longitude}, the distance on a parallel of latitude
      between two meridians that make an angle of one degree
      with each other at the poles -- a distance which varies as
      the cosine of the latitude, being at the equator 69.16
      statute miles.

   {To a degree}, to an extreme; exceedingly; as, mendacious to
      a degree.
      [1913 Webster]

            It has been said that Scotsmen . . . are . . . grave
            to a degree on occasions when races more favored by
            nature are gladsome to excess.        --Prof.
                                                  Wilson.
