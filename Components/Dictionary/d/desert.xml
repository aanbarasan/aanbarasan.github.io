      <WordDefinition>Desert
   (1.) Heb. midbar, "pasture-ground;" an open tract for pasturage;
   a common (Joel 2:22). The "backside of the desert" (Ex. 3:1) is
   the west of the desert, the region behind a man, as the east is
   the region in front. The same Hebrew word is rendered
   "wildernes," and is used of the country lying between Egypt and
   Palestine (Gen. 21:14, 21; Ex. 4:27; 19:2; Josh. 1:4), the
   wilderness of the wanderings. It was a grazing tract, where the
   flocks and herds of the Israelites found pasturage during the
   whole of their journey to the Promised Land.
   
     The same Hebrew word is used also to denote the wilderness of
   Arabia, which in winter and early spring supplies good pasturage
   to the flocks of the nomad tribes than roam over it (1 Kings
   9:18).
   
     The wilderness of Judah is the mountainous region along the
   western shore of the Dead Sea, where David fed his father's
   flocks (1 Sam. 17:28; 26:2). Thus in both of these instances the
   word denotes a country without settled inhabitants and without
   streams of water, but having good pasturage for cattle; a
   country of wandering tribes, as distinguished from that of a
   settled people (Isa. 35:1; 50:2; Jer. 4:11). Such, also, is the
   meaning of the word "wilderness" in Matt. 3:3; 15:33; Luke 15:4.
   
     (2.) The translation of the Hebrew _Aribah'_, "an arid tract"
   (Isa. 35:1, 6; 40:3; 41:19; 51:3, etc.). The name Arabah is
   specially applied to the deep valley of the Jordan (the Ghor of
   the Arabs), which extends from the lake of Tiberias to the
   Elanitic gulf. While _midbar_ denotes properly a pastoral
   region, _arabah_ denotes a wilderness. It is also translated
   "plains;" as "the plains of Jericho" (Josh. 5:10; 2 Kings 25:5),
   "the plains of Moab" (Num. 22:1; Deut. 34:1, 8), "the plains of
   the wilderness" (2 Sam. 17:16).
   
     (3.) In the Revised Version of Num. 21:20 the Hebrew word
   _jeshimon_ is properly rendered "desert," meaning the waste
   tracts on both shores of the Dead Sea. This word is also
   rendered "desert" in Ps. 78:40; 106:14; Isa. 43:19, 20. It
   denotes a greater extent of uncultivated country than the other
   words so rendered. It is especially applied to the desert of the
   peninsula of Arabia (Num. 21:20; 23:28), the most terrible of
   all the deserts with which the Israelites were acquainted. It is
   called "the desert" in Ex. 23:31; Deut. 11:24. (See {JESHIMON}.)
   
     (4.) A dry place; hence a desolation (Ps. 9:6), desolate (Lev.
   26:34); the rendering of the Hebrew word _horbah'_. It is
   rendered "desert" only in Ps. 102:6, Isa. 48:21, and Ezek. 13:4,
   where it means the wilderness of Sinai.
   
     (5.) This word is the symbol of the Jewish church when they
   had forsaken God (Isa. 40:3). Nations destitute of the knowledge
   of God are called a "wilderness" (32:15, _midbar_). It is a
   symbol of temptation, solitude, and persecution (Isa. 27:10,
   _midbar_; 33:9, _arabah_).
