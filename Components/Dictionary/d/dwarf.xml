      <WordDefinition>Dwarf \Dwarf\, n.; pl. {Dwarfs}. [OE. dwergh, dwerf, dwarf, AS.

   dvergr, Sw. &amp; Dan. dverg; of unknown origin.]

      of its species or kind.

      to a pathological condition which causes a distortion of
      the proportions of body parts to each other, such as the

      who has normal body proportions is usually called a
      {midget}.

         below the usual or normal size; as, a dwarf pear tree;
         dwarf honeysuckle.
