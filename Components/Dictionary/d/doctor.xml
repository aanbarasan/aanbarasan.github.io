      <WordDefinition>Doctor
   (Luke 2:46; 5:17; Acts 5:34), a teacher. The Jewish doctors
   taught and disputed in synagogues, or wherever they could find
   an audience. Their disciples were allowed to propose to them
   questions. They assumed the office without any appointment to
   it. The doctors of the law were principally of the sect of the
   Pharisees. Schools were established after the destruction of
   Jerusalem at Babylon and Tiberias, in which academical degrees
   were conferred on those who passed a certain examination. Those
   of the school of Tiberias were called by the title "rabbi," and
   those of Babylon by that of "master."
