      <WordDefinition>Dart
   an instrument of war; a light spear. "Fiery darts" (Eph. 6:16)
   are so called in allusion to the habit of discharging darts from
   the bow while they are on fire or armed with some combustible
   material. Arrows are compared to lightning (Deut. 32:23, 42; Ps.
   7:13; 120:4).
