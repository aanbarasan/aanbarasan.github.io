      <WordDefinition>Devil
   (Gr. diabolos), a slanderer, the arch-enemy of man's spiritual
   interest (Job 1:6; Rev. 2:10; Zech. 3:1). He is called also "the
   accuser of the brethen" (Rev. 12:10).
   
     In Lev. 17:7 the word "devil" is the translation of the Hebrew
   _sair_, meaning a "goat" or "satyr" (Isa. 13:21; 34:14),
   alluding to the wood-daemons, the objects of idolatrous worship
   among the heathen.
   
     In Deut. 32:17 and Ps. 106:37 it is the translation of Hebrew
   _shed_, meaning lord, and idol, regarded by the Jews as a
   "demon," as the word is rendered in the Revised Version.
   
     In the narratives of the Gospels regarding the "casting out of
   devils" a different Greek word (daimon) is used. In the time of
   our Lord there were frequent cases of demoniacal possession
   (Matt. 12:25-30; Mark 5:1-20; Luke 4:35; 10:18, etc.).
