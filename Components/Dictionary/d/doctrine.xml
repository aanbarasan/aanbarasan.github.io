   1. Teaching; instruction.
      [1913 Webster]

            He taught them many things by parables, and said
            unto them in his doctrine, Hearken.   -- Mark iv. 2.

   2. That which is taught; what is held, put forth as true, and
      supported by a teacher, a school, or a sect; a principle
      or position, or the body of principles, in any branch of
      knowledge; any tenet or dogma; a principle of faith; as,

   {The Monroe doctrine} (Politics), a policy enunciated by
      President Monroe (Message, Dec. 2, 1823), the essential
      feature of which is that the United States will regard as
      an unfriendly act any attempt on the part of European
      powers to extend their systems on this continent, or any
      interference to oppress, or in any manner control the
      destiny of, governments whose independence had been
      acknowledged by the United States.

   Syn: Precept; tenet; principle; maxim; dogma.

   Usage: -- {Doctrine}, {Precept}. Doctrine denotes whatever is
          recommended as a speculative truth to the belief of
          others. Precept is a rule down to be obeyed. Doctrine
          supposes a teacher; precept supposes a superior, with
          a right to command. The doctrines of the Bible; the
          precepts of our holy religion.
          [1913 Webster]

          [1913 Webster]
