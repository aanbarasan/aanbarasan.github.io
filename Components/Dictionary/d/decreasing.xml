      <WordDefinition>Decrease \De*crease"\, v. i. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Decreased}; p. pr. &amp;
   vb. n. {Decreasing}.] [OE. decrecen, fr. OF. decreistre, F.
   d['e]cro[^i]tre, or from the OF. noun (see {Decrease}, n.),
   fr. L. decrescere to grow less; de + crescere to grow. See
   {Crescent}, and cf. {Increase}.]
   To grow less, -- opposed to increase; to be diminished
   gradually, in size, degree, number, duration, etc., or in
   strength, quality, or excellence; as, they days decrease in
   length from June to December.
   [1913 Webster]

         He must increase, but I must decrease.   --John iii.
                                                  30.

   Syn: To {Decrease}, {Diminish}.

   Usage: Things usually decrease or fall off by degrees, and
          from within, or through some cause which is
          imperceptible; as, the flood decreases; the cold
          decreases; their affection has decreased. Things
          commonly diminish by an influence from without, or one
          which is apparent; as, the army was diminished by
          disease; his property is diminishing through
          extravagance; their affection has diminished since
          their separation their separation. The turn of
          thought, however, is often such that these words may
          be interchanged.
          [1913 Webster]
