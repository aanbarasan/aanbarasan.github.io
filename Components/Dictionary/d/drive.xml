      <WordDefinition>Drive \Drive\, n.
   1. In various games, as tennis, cricket, etc., the act of
      player who drives the ball; the stroke or blow; the flight
      of the ball, etc., so driven.
      [Webster 1913 Suppl.]

   2. (Golf) A stroke from the tee, generally a full shot made
      with a driver; also, the distance covered by such a
      stroke.
      [Webster 1913 Suppl.]

   Note: Drive, in all its senses, implies forcible or violent
         action. It is the reverse of to lead. To drive a body
         is to move it by applying a force behind; to lead is to
         cause to move by applying the force before, or in
         front. It takes a variety of meanings, according to the
         objects by which it is followed; as, to drive an
         engine, to direct and regulate its motions; to drive
         logs, to keep them in the current of a river and direct
         them in their course; to drive feathers or down, to
         place them in a machine, which, by a current of air,
         drives off the lightest to one end, and collects them
         by themselves. ``My thrice-driven bed of down.''
         --Shak.
