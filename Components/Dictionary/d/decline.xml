      <WordDefinition>Decline \De*cline"\, n. [F. d['e]clin. See {Decline}, v. i.]
   1. A falling off; a tendency to a worse state; diminution or
      decay; deterioration; also, the period when a thing is
      tending toward extinction or a less perfect state; as, the
      decline of life; the decline of strength; the decline of
      virtue and religion.
      [1913 Webster]

            Their fathers lived in the decline of literature.
                                                  --Swift.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Med.) That period of a disorder or paroxysm when the
      symptoms begin to abate in violence; as, the decline of a
      fever.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. A gradual sinking and wasting away of the physical
      faculties; any wasting disease, esp. pulmonary
      consumption; as, to die of a decline. --Dunglison.

   Syn: {Decline}, {Decay}, {Consumption}.

   Usage: Decline marks the first stage in a downward progress;
          decay indicates the second stage, and denotes a
          tendency to ultimate destruction; consumption marks a
          steady decay from an internal exhaustion of strength.
          The health may experience a decline from various
          causes at any period of life; it is naturally subject
          to decay with the advance of old age; consumption may
          take place at almost any period of life, from disease
          which wears out the constitution. In popular language
          decline is often used as synonymous with consumption.
          By a gradual decline, states and communities lose
          their strength and vigor; by progressive decay, they
          are stripped of their honor, stability, and greatness;
          by a consumption of their resources and vital energy,
          they are led rapidly on to a completion of their
          existence.
