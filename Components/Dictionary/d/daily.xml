   Syn: {Daily}, {Diurnal}.

   Usage: Daily is Anglo-Saxon, and diurnal is Latin. The former
          is used in reference to the ordinary concerns of life;
          as, daily wants, daily cares, daily employments. The
          latter is appropriated chiefly by astronomers to what
          belongs to the astronomical day; as, the diurnal
          revolution of the earth.
          [1913 Webster]

                Appointed, which declares his dignity,
                And the regard of Heaven on all his ways.
                                                  --Milton.
          [1913 Webster]

                Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound
                Within the visible diurnal sphere. --Milton.
