      <WordDefinition>data
     
        &lt;data, data processing, jargon&gt; /day't*/ (Or "raw data")
        Numbers, {characters}, {images}, or other method of recording,
        in a form which can be assessed by a human or (especially)
        input into a {computer}, stored and {processed} there, or
        transmitted on some {digital channel}.  Computers nearly
        always represent data in {binary}.
     
        Data on its own has no meaning, only when interpreted by some
        kind of {data processing system} does it take on meaning and
        become {information}.
     
        People or computers can find patterns in data to perceive
        information, and information can be used to enhance
        {knowledge}.  Since knowledge is prerequisite to wisdom, we
        always want more data and information.  But, as modern
        societies verge on {information overload}, we especially need
        better ways to find patterns.
     
        1234567.89 is data.
     
        "Your bank balance has jumped 8087% to $1234567.89" is
        information.
     
        "Nobody owes me that much money" is knowledge.
     
        "I'd better talk to the bank before I spend it, because of
        what has happened to other people" is wisdom.

      <WordDefinition>Data \Da"ta\, n. pl. [L. pl. of datum.]
   1. See {Datum}.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. a collection of facts, observations, or other information
      related to a particular question or problem; as, the
      historical data show that the budget deficit is only a
      small factor in determining interest rates.

   Note: The term in this sense is used especially in reference
         to experimental observations collected in the course of
         a controlled scientific investigation.
         [PJC]

   3. (Computers) information, most commonly in the form of a
      series of binary digits, stored on a physical storage
      medium for manipulation by a computer program. It is
      contrasted with the {program} which is a series of
      instructions used by the central processing unit of a
      computer to manipulate the data. In some conputers data
      and execuatble programs are stored in separate locations.
