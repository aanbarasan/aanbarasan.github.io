      <WordDefinition>dd
     
        A {Unix} copy command with special options suitable for
        block-oriented devices; it was often used in heavy-handed
        system maintenance, as in "Let's "dd" the {root partition}
        onto a tape, then use the {boot PROM} to load it back on to a
        new disk".
     
        The Unix "dd" was designed with a weird, distinctly non-Unixy
        keyword option syntax reminiscent of {IBM} {System/360} JCL
        (which had an elaborate DD "Dataset Definition" specification
        for I/O devices); though the command filled a need, the
        interface design was clearly a prank.
     
        The jargon usage is now very rare outside Unix sites and now
        nearly obsolete even there, as "dd" has been {deprecated} for
        a long time (though it has no exact replacement).  The term
        has been displaced by {BLT} or simple English "copy".

      <WordDefinition>dd /dee-dee/ vt. [Unix: from IBM {JCL}] Equivalent to {cat} or {BLT}.
   Originally the name of a Unix copy command with special options suitable
   for block-oriented devices; it was often used in heavy-handed system
   maintenance, as in "Let's `dd' the root partition onto a tape, then use
   the boot PROM to load it back on to a new disk". The Unix `dd(1)' was
   designed with a weird, distinctly non-Unixy keyword option syntax
   reminiscent of IBM System/360 JCL (which had an elaborate DD `Dataset
   Definition' specification for I/O devices); though the command filled a
   need, the interface design was clearly a prank. The jargon usage is now
   very rare outside Unix sites and now nearly obsolete even there, as
   `dd(1)' has been {deprecated} for a long time (though it has no exact
   replacement). The term has been displaced by {BLT} or simple English
   `copy'.
