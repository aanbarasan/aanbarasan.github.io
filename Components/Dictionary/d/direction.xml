   6. (Gun.) The pointing of a piece with reference to an

   Syn: Administration; guidance; management; superintendence;
        oversight; government; order; command; guide; clew.

   Usage: {Direction}, {Control}, {Command}, {Order}. These
          words, as here compared, have reference to the
          exercise of power over the actions of others. Control
          is negative, denoting power to restrain; command is
          positive, implying a right to enforce obedience;
          directions are commands containing instructions how to
          act. Order conveys more prominently the idea of
          authority than the word direction. A shipmaster has
          the command of his vessel; he gives orders or
          directions to the seamen as to the mode of sailing it;
          and exercises a due control over the passengers.
          [1913 Webster]
