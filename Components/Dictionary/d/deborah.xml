      <WordDefinition>Deborah
   a bee. (1.) Rebekah's nurse. She accompanied her mistress when
   she left her father's house in Padan-aram to become the wife of
   Isaac (Gen. 24:59). Many years afterwards she died at Bethel,
   and was buried under the "oak of weeping", Allon-bachuth (35:8).
   
     (2.) A prophetess, "wife" (woman?) of Lapidoth. Jabin, the
   king of Hazor, had for twenty years held Israel in degrading
   subjection. The spirit of patriotism seemed crushed out of the
   nation. In this emergency Deborah roused the people from their
   lethargy. Her fame spread far and wide. She became a "mother in
   Israel" (Judg. 4:6, 14; 5:7), and "the children of Israel came
   up to her for judgment" as she sat in her tent under the palm
   tree "between Ramah and Bethel." Preparations were everywhere
   made by her direction for the great effort to throw off the yoke
   of bondage. She summoned Barak from Kadesh to take the command
   of 10,000 men of Zebulun and Naphtali, and lead them to Mount
   Tabor on the plain of Esdraelon at its north-east end. With his
   aid she organized this army. She gave the signal for attack, and
   the Hebrew host rushed down impetuously upon the army of Jabin,
   which was commanded by Sisera, and gained a great and decisive
   victory. The Canaanitish army almost wholly perished. That was a
   great and ever-memorable day in Israel. In Judg. 5 is given the
   grand triumphal ode, the "song of Deborah," which she wrote in
   grateful commemoration of that great deliverance. (See LAPIDOTH
   ï¿½T0002240, {JABIN} [2].)
