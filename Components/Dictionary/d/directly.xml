      [1913 Webster]

   Note: This use of the word is common in England, especially
         in colloquial speech, but it can hardly be regarded as
         a well-sanctioned or desirable use.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Directly proportional} (Math.), proportional in the order of
      the terms; increasing or decreasing together, and with a
      constant ratio; -- opposed to {inversely proportional}.

   Syn: Immediately; forthwith; straightway; instantly;
        instantaneously; soon; promptly; openly; expressly.

   Usage: -- {Directly}, {Immediately}, {Instantly},
          {Instantaneously}. Directly denotes, without any delay
          or diversion of attention; immediately implies,
          without any interposition of other occupation;
          instantly implies, without any intervention of time.
          Hence, ``I will do it directly,'' means, ``I will go
          straightway about it.'' ``I will do it immediately,''
          means, ``I will do it as the very next thing.'' ``I
          will do it instantly,'' allows not a particle of
          delay. Instantaneously, like instantly, marks an
          interval too small to be appreciable, but commonly
          relates to physical causes; as, the powder touched by
          fire instantaneously exploded.
          [1913 Webster]
