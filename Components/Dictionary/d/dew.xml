      <WordDefinition>Dew
   "There is no dew properly so called in Palestine, for there is
   no moisture in the hot summer air to be chilled into dew-drops
   by the coldness of the night. From May till October rain is
   unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day after
   day. The heat becomes intense, the ground hard, and vegetation
   would perish but for the moist west winds that come each night
   from the sea. The bright skies cause the heat of the day to
   radiate very quickly into space, so that the nights are as cold
   as the day is the reverse, a peculiarity of climate from which
   poor Jacob suffered thousands of years ago (Gen. 31:40). To this
   coldness of the night air the indispensable watering of all
   plant-life is due. The winds, loaded with moisture, are robbed
   of it as they pass over the land, the cold air condensing it
   into drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist on
   every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created rests
   like a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills,
   which raise their heads above it like so many islands. At
   sunrise, however, the scene speedily changes. By the kindling
   light the mist is transformed into vast snow-white clouds, which
   presently break into separate masses and rise up the
   mountain-sides, to disappear in the blue above, dissipated by
   the increasing heat. These are 'the morning clouds and the early
   dew that go away' of which Hosea (6:4; 13:3) speaks so
   touchingly" (Geikie's The Holy Land, etc., i., p. 72). Dew is a
   source of great fertility (Gen. 27:28; Deut. 33:13; Zech. 8:12),
   and its withdrawal is regarded as a curse from God (2 Sam. 1:21;
   1 Kings 17:1). It is the symbol of a multitude (2 Sam. 17:12;
   Ps. 110:3); and from its refreshing influence it is an emblem of
   brotherly love and harmony (Ps. 133:3), and of rich spiritual
   blessings (Hos. 14:5).
