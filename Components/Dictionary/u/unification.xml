      <WordDefinition>unification
     
        &lt;programming&gt; The generalisation of {pattern matching} that is
        the {logic programming} equivalent of {instantiation} in
        {logic}.  When two {term}s are to be unified, they are
        compared.  If they are both constants then the result of
        unification is success if they are equal else failure.  If one
        is a variable then it is bound to the other, which may be any
        term (which satisfies an "{occurs check}"), and the
        unification succeeds.  If both terms are structures then each
        pair of sub-terms is unified {recursive}ly and the unification
        succeeds if all the sub-terms unify.
     
        The result of unification is either failure or success with a
        set of variable bindings, known as a "{unifier}".  There may
        be many such unifiers for any pair of terms but there will be
        at most one "{most general unifier}", other unifiers simply
        add extra bindings for sub-terms which are variables in the
        original terms.
