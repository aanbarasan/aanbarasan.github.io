                                        the UK in 1962. The dictatorial
                                        regime of Idi AMIN (1971-79) was
                                        responsible for the deaths of some
                                        300,000 opponents; guerrilla war and
                                        human rights abuses under Milton
                                        OBOTE (1980-85) claimed another
                                        100,000 lives. During the 1990s the
                                        government promulgated non-party
                                        presidential and legislative
                                        elections.

   Economy Uganda
   --------------
                    Economy - overview: Uganda has substantial natural
                                        resources, including fertile soils,
                                        regular rainfall, and sizable
                                        mineral deposits of copper and
                                        cobalt. Agriculture is the most
                                        important sector of the economy,
                                        employing over 80% of the work
                                        force. Coffee is the major export
                                        crop and accounts for the bulk of
                                        export revenues. Since 1986, the
                                        government - with the support of
                                        foreign countries and international
                                        agencies - has acted to rehabilitate
                                        and stabilize the economy by
                                        undertaking currency reform, raising
                                        producer prices on export crops,
                                        increasing prices of petroleum
                                        products, and improving civil
                                        service wages. The policy changes
                                        are especially aimed at dampening
                                        inflation and boosting production
                                        and export earnings. During 1990-
                                        2001, the economy turned in a solid
                                        performance based on continued
                                        investment in the rehabilitation of
                                        infrastructure, improved incentives
                                        for production and exports, reduced
                                        inflation, gradually improved
                                        domestic security, and the return of
                                        exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs.
                                        Ongoing Ugandan involvement in the
                                        war in the Democratic Republic of
                                        the Congo, corruption within the
                                        government, and slippage in the
                                        government's determination to press
                                        reforms raise doubts about the
                                        continuation of strong growth. In
                                        2000, Uganda qualified for enhanced

                                        billion and Paris Club debt relief
                                        worth $145 million. These amounts
                                        combined with the original HIPC debt
                                        relief added up to about $2 billion.
                                        Growth for 2001 was held back
                                        because of a continued decline in
                                        the price of coffee, Uganda's
                                        principal export.
