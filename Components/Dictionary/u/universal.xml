      unlimited; general; all-reaching; all-pervading; as,

      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Universal and its derivatives are used in common
         discourse for general and its derivatives. See
         {General}.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. Constituting or considered as a whole; total; entire;
      whole; as, the universal world. --Shak.

      animals; (universal negative) No men are omniscient.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Universal chuck} (Mach.), a chuck, as for a lathe, having
      jaws which can be moved simultaneously so as to grasp
      objects of various sizes.

   {Universal church}, the whole church of God in the world; the
      catholic church. See the Note under {Catholic}, a., 1.

   {Universal coupling}. (Mach.) Same as {Universal joint},
      below.

   {Universal dial}, a dial by which the hour may be found in
      any part of the world, or under any elevation of the pole.
      

   {Universal instrument} (Astron.), a species of altitude and
      azimuth instrument, the peculiarity of which is, that the
      object end of the telescope is placed at right angles to
      the eye end, with a prism of total reflection at the
      angle, and the eye end constitutes a portion of the
      horizontal axis of the instrument, having the eyepiece at
      the pivot and in the center of the altitude circle, so
      that the eye has convenient access to both at the same
      time.

   {Universal joint} (Mach.), a contrivance used for joining two
      shafts or parts of a machine endwise, so that the one may
      give rotary motion to the other when forming an angle with
      it, or may move freely in all directions with respect to
      the other, as by means of a cross connecting the forked
      ends of the two shafts (Fig. 1). Since this joint can not
      act when the angle of the shafts is less than 140[deg], a
      double joint of the same kind is sometimes used for giving
      rotary motion at angles less than 140[deg] (Fig. 2).

   {Universal umbel} (Bot.), a primary or general umbel; the
      first or largest set of rays in a compound umbel; --
