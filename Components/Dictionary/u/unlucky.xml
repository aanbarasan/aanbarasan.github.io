      <WordDefinition>Unlucky \Un*luck"y\, a.
   1. Not lucky; not successful; unfortunate; ill-fated;
      unhappy; as, an unlucky man; an unlucky adventure; an
      unlucky throw of dice; an unlucky game.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: This word is properly applied to incidents in which
         failure results from chance or fortuity, as in games of
         hazard, rather than from lack or feebleness of effort.

   2. Bringing bad luck; ill-omened; inauspicious.
      [1913 Webster]

            Haunt me not with that unlucky face.  --Dryden.
