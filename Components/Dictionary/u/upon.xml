   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Upon conveys a more distinct notion that on carries
         with it of something that literally or metaphorically
         bears or supports. It is less employed than it used to
         be, on having for the most part taken its place. Some
         expressions formed with it belong only to old style;
         as, upon pity they were taken away; that is, in
         consequence of pity: upon the rate of thirty thousand;
         that is, amounting to the rate: to die upon the hand;
         that is, by means of the hand: he had a garment upon;
         that is, upon himself: the time is coming fast upon;
         that is, upon the present time. By the omission of its
         object, upon acquires an adverbial sense, as in the
         last two examples.
         [1913 Webster]

   {To assure upon} (Law), to promise; to undertake.

   {To come upon}. See under {Come}.

   {To take upon}, to assume.
      [1913 Webster]
