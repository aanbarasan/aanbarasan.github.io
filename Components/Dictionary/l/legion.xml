      <WordDefinition>Legion
   a regiment of the Roman army, the number of men composing which
   differed at different times. It originally consisted of three
   thousand men, but in the time of Christ consisted of six
   thousand, exclusive of horsemen, who were in number a tenth of
   the foot-men. The word is used (Matt. 26:53; Mark 5:9) to
   express simply a great multitude.
