      <WordDefinition>LOVE, n.  A temporary insanity curable by marriage or by removal of
the patient from the influences under which he incurred the disorder. 
This disease, like _caries_ and many other ailments, is prevalent only
among civilized races living under artificial conditions; barbarous
nations breathing pure air and eating simple food enjoy immunity from
its ravages.  It is sometimes fatal, but more frequently to the
physician than to the patient.

      <WordDefinition>Love
   This word seems to require explanation only in the case of its
   use by our Lord in his interview with "Simon, the son of Jonas,"
   after his resurrection (John 21:16, 17). When our Lord says,
   "Lovest thou me?" he uses the Greek word _agapas_; and when
   Simon answers, he uses the Greek word _philo_, i.e., "I love."
   This is the usage in the first and second questions put by our
   Lord; but in the third our Lord uses Simon's word. The
   distinction between these two Greek words is thus fitly
   described by Trench:, "_Agapan_ has more of judgment and
   deliberate choice; _philein_ has more of attachment and peculiar
   personal affection. Thus the 'Lovest thou' (Gr. agapas) on the
   lips of the Lord seems to Peter at this moment too cold a word,
   as though his Lord were keeping him at a distance, or at least
   not inviting him to draw near, as in the passionate yearning of
   his heart he desired now to do. Therefore he puts by the word
   and substitutes his own stronger 'I love' (Gr. philo) in its
   room. A second time he does the same. And now he has conquered;
   for when the Lord demands a third time whether he loves him, he
   does it in the word which alone will satisfy Peter ('Lovest
   thou,' Gr. phileis), which alone claims from him that personal
   attachment and affection with which indeed he knows that his
   heart is full."
   
     In 1 Cor. 13 the apostle sets forth the excellency of love, as
   the word "charity" there is rendered in the Revised Version.
