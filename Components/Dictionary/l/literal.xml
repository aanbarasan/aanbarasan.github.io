      <WordDefinition>literal
     
        &lt;programming&gt; A constant made available to a process, by
        inclusion in the executable text.  Most modern systems do not
        allow texts to modify themselves during execution, so literals
        are indeed constant; their value is written at compile-time
        and is read-only at run time.
     
        In contrast, values placed in variables or files and accessed
        by the process via a symbolic name, can be changed during
        execution.  This may be an asset.  For example, messages can
        be given in a choice of languages by placing the translation
        in a file.
     
        Literals are used when such modification is not desired.  The
        name of the file mentioned above (not its content), or a
        physical constant such as 3.14159, might be coded as a
        literal.  Literals can be accessed quickly, a potential
        advantage of their use.
