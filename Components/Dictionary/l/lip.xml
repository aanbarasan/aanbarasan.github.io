      <WordDefinition>Lip
   besides its literal sense (Isa. 37:29, etc.), is used in the
   original (saphah) metaphorically for an edge or border, as of a
   cup (1 Kings 7:26), a garment (Ex. 28:32), a curtain (26:4), the
   sea (Gen. 22:17), the Jordan (2 Kings 2:13). To "open the lips"
   is to begin to speak (Job 11:5); to "refrain the lips" is to
   keep silence (Ps. 40:9; 1 Pet. 3:10). The "fruit of the lips"
   (Heb. 13:15) is praise, and the "calves of the lips"
   thank-offerings (Hos. 14:2). To "shoot out the lip" is to
   manifest scorn and defiance (Ps. 22:7). Many similar forms of
   expression are found in Scripture.
