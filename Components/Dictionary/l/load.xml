      <WordDefinition>load
     
        1. To copy {data} (often {program} {code} to be {run}) into
        {memory}, possibly {parsing} it somehow in the process.
        E.g. "{WordPerfect} can't load this {RTF} file - are you sure
        it didn't get corrupted in the {download}?"  Opposite of
        {save}.
     
        2. The degree to which a computer, {network}, or other
        resource is used, sometimes expressed as a percentage of the
        maximum available.  E.g. "What kind of CPU load does that
        program give?", "The network's constantly running at 100%
        load".  Sometimes used, by extension, to mean "to increase the
        level of use of a resource".  E.g. "Loading a spreadsheet
        really loads the CPU".  See also: {load balancing}.
     
        3. To {install} a piece of {software} onto a system.
        E.g. "The computer guy is gonna come load Excel on my laptop
        for me".  This usage is widely considered to be incorrect.
