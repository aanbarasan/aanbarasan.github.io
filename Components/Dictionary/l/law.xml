      <WordDefinition>LAW, n.

    Once Law was sitting on the bench,
        And Mercy knelt a-weeping.
    "Clear out!" he cried, "disordered wench!
        Nor come before me creeping.
    Upon your knees if you appear,
    'Tis plain your have no standing here."

    Then Justice came.  His Honor cried:
        "_Your_ status? -- devil seize you!"
    "_Amica curiae,_" she replied --
        "Friend of the court, so please you."
    "Begone!" he shouted -- "there's the door --
    I never saw your face before!"
                                                                  G.J.

      <WordDefinition>Law
   a rule of action. (1.) The Law of Nature is the will of God as
   to human conduct, founded on the moral difference of things, and
   discoverable by natural light (Rom. 1:20; 2:14, 15). This law
   binds all men at all times. It is generally designated by the
   term conscience, or the capacity of being influenced by the
   moral relations of things.
   
     (2.) The Ceremonial Law prescribes under the Old Testament the
   rites and ceremonies of worship. This law was obligatory only
   till Christ, of whom these rites were typical, had finished his
   work (Heb. 7:9, 11; 10:1; Eph. 2:16). It was fulfilled rather
   than abrogated by the gospel.
   
     (3.) The Judicial Law, the law which directed the civil policy
   of the Hebrew nation.
   
     (4.) The Moral Law is the revealed will of God as to human
   conduct, binding on all men to the end of time. It was
   promulgated at Sinai. It is perfect (Ps. 19:7), perpetual (Matt.
   5:17, 18), holy (Rom. 7:12), good, spiritual (14), and exceeding
   broad (Ps. 119:96). Although binding on all, we are not under it
   as a covenant of works (Gal. 3:17). (See {COMMANDMENTS}.)
   
     (5.) Positive Laws are precepts founded only on the will of
   God. They are right because God commands them.
   
     (6.) Moral positive laws are commanded by God because they are
   right.

            who are under the law . . . But now the
            righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
            being witnessed by the law and the prophets. --Rom.
                                                  iii. 19, 21.
