      <WordDefinition>League
   a treaty or confederacy. The Jews were forbidden to enter into
   an alliance of any kind (1) with the Canaanites (Ex. 23:32, 33;
   34:12-16); (2) with the Amalekites (Ex. 17:8, 14; Deut.
   25:17-19); (3) with the Moabites and Ammonites (Deut. 2:9, 19).
   Treaties were permitted to be entered into with all other
   nations. Thus David maintained friendly intercourse with the
   kings of Tyre and Hamath, and Solomon with the kings of Tyre and
   Egypt.

   to bind; cf. Sp. liga. Cf. {Ally} a confederate, {Ligature}.]
   1. An alliance or combination of two or more nations,
      parties, organizations, or persons, for the accomplishment
      of a purpose which requires a continued course of action,
      as for mutual defense, or for furtherance of commercial,
      religious, or political interests, etc.
      [1913 Webster]

            And let there be
            'Twixt us and them no league, nor amity. --Denham.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Specifically: (Sports) An association of sports teams that
      establishes rules of play, decides questions of membership
      in the league, and organizes matches between the member
      teams. In some cases a sports league is called a
      {conference}, as in the {National Football Conference}.
      [PJC]

   Note: A league may be offensive or defensive, or both;
         offensive, when the parties agree to unite in attacking
         a common enemy; defensive, when they agree to a mutual
         defense of each other against an enemy.
         [1913 Webster]

   {The Holy League}, an alliance of Roman Catholics formed in
      1576 by influence of the Duke of Guise for the exclusion
      of Protestants from the throne of France.

   {Solemn League and Covenant}. See {Covenant},2.

   {The land league}, an association, organized in Dublin in
      1879, to promote the interests of the Irish tenantry, its
      avowed objects being to secure fixity of tenure, fair

      declared illegal by Parliament, but vigorous prosecutions
      have failed to suppress it.

   Syn: Alliance; confederacy; confederation; coalition;
        combination; compact; co["o]peration.

   length, F. lieue, Pr. lega, legua, It. &amp; LL. lega, Sp. legua,
   Pg. legoa, legua; all fr. LL. leuca, of Celtic origin: cf.
   Arm. leo, lev (perh. from French), Ir. leige (perh. from
