      <WordDefinition>Lac \Lac\, n. [Per. lak; akin to Skr. l[=a]ksh[=a]: cf. F.
   lague, It. &amp; NL. lacca. Cf. {Lake} a color, {Lacquer},
   {Litmus}.]
   A resinous substance produced mainly on the banyan tree, but
   to some extent on other trees, by the {Laccifer lacca}
   (formerly {Coccus lacca}), a scale-shaped insect, the female
   of which fixes herself on the bark, and exudes from the
   margin of her body this resinous substance.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: {Stick-lac} is the substance in its natural state,
         incrusting small twigs. When broken off, and the
         coloring matter partly removed, the granular residuum
         is called {seed-lac}. When melted, and reduced to a
         thin crust, it is called {shell-lac} or {shellac}. Lac
         is an important ingredient in sealing wax, dyes,
         varnishes, and lacquers.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Ceylon lac}, a resinous exudation of the tree {Croton
      lacciferum}, resembling lac.

   {Lac dye}, a scarlet dye obtained from stick-lac.

   {Lac lake}, the coloring matter of lac dye when precipitated
      from its solutions by alum.

   {Mexican lac}, an exudation of the tree {Croton Draco}.
