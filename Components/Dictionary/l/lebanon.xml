      <WordDefinition>Lebanon
   white, "the white mountain of Syria," is the loftiest and most
   celebrated mountain range in Syria. It is a branch running
   southward from the Caucasus, and at its lower end forking into
   two parallel ranges, the eastern or Anti-Lebanon, and the
   western or Lebanon proper. They enclose a long valley (Josh.
   11:17) of from 5 to 8 miles in width, called by Roman writers
   Coele-Syria, now called el-Buka'a, "the valley," a prolongation
   of the valley of the Jordan.
   
     Lebanon proper, Jebel es-Sharki, commences at its southern
   extremity in the gorge of the Leontes, the ancient Litany, and
   extends north-east, parallel to the Mediterranean coast, as far
   as the river Eleutherus, at the plain of Emesa, "the entering of
   Hamath" (Num. 34:8; 1 Kings 8:65), in all about 90 geographical
   miles in extent. The average height of this range is from 6,000
   to 8,000 feet; the peak of Jebel Mukhmel is about 10,200 feet,
   and the Sannin about 9,000. The highest peaks are covered with
   perpetual snow and ice. In the recesses of the range wild beasts
   as of old still abound (2 Kings 14:9; Cant. 4:8). The scenes of
   the Lebanon are remarkable for their grandeur and beauty, and
   supplied the sacred writers with many expressive similes (Ps.
   29:5, 6; 72:16; 104:16-18; Cant. 4:15; Isa. 2:13; 35:2; 60:13;
   Hos. 14:5). It is famous for its cedars (Cant. 5:15), its wines
   (Hos. 14:7), and its cool waters (Jer. 18:14). The ancient
   inhabitants were Giblites and Hivites (Josh. 13:5; Judg. 3:3).
   It was part of the Phoenician kingdom (1 Kings 5:2-6).
   
     The eastern range, or Anti-Lebanon, or "Lebanon towards the
   sunrising," runs nearly parallel with the western from the plain
   of Emesa till it connects with the hills of Galilee in the
   south. The height of this range is about 5,000 feet. Its highest
   peak is Hermon (q.v.), from which a number of lesser ranges
   radiate.
   
     Lebanon is first mentioned in the description of the boundary
   of Palestine (Deut. 1:7; 11:24). It was assigned to Israel, but
   was never conquered (Josh. 13:2-6; Judg. 3:1-3).
   
     The Lebanon range is now inhabited by a population of about
   300,000 Christians, Maronites, and Druses, and is ruled by a
   Christian governor. The Anti-Lebanon is inhabited by
   Mohammedans, and is under a Turkish ruler.

   Introduction Lebanon
   --------------------
                            Background: Lebanon has made progress toward
                                        rebuilding its political
                                        institutions since 1991 and the end
                                        of the devastating 16-year civil
                                        war. Under the Ta'if Accord - the
                                        blueprint for national
                                        reconciliation - the Lebanese have
                                        established a more equitable
                                        political system, particularly by
                                        giving Muslims a greater say in the
                                        political process while
                                        institutionalizing sectarian
                                        divisions in the government. Since
                                        the end of the war, the Lebanese
                                        have conducted several successful
                                        elections, most of the militias have
                                        been weakened or disbanded, and the
                                        Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) have
                                        extended central government
                                        authority over about two-thirds of
                                        the country. Hizballah, the radical
                                        Shi'a party, retains its weapons.
                                        Syria maintains about 20,000 troops
                                        in Lebanon based mainly in Beirut,
                                        North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley.
                                        Syria's troop deployment was
                                        legitimized by the Arab League
                                        during Lebanon's civil war and in
                                        the Ta'if Accord. Damascus justifies
                                        its continued military presence in
                                        Lebanon by citing Beirut's requests
                                        and the failure of the Lebanese
                                        Government to implement all of the
                                        constitutional reforms in the Ta'if
                                        Accord. Israel's withdrawal from its
                                        security zone in southern Lebanon in
                                        May of 2000, however, has emboldened
                                        some Lebanese Christians and Druze
                                        to demand that Syria withdraw its
                                        forces as well.

   ---------------
                    Economy - overview: The 1975-91 civil war seriously
                                        damaged Lebanon's economic
                                        infrastructure, cut national output
                                        by half, and all but ended Lebanon's
                                        position as a Middle Eastern
                                        entrepot and banking hub. Peace
                                        enabled the central government to
                                        restore control in Beirut, begin
                                        collecting taxes, and regain access
                                        to key port and government
                                        facilities. Economic recovery was
                                        helped by a financially sound
                                        banking system and resilient small-
                                        and medium-scale manufacturers.
                                        Family remittances, banking
                                        services, manufactured and farm
                                        exports, and international aid
                                        provided the main sources of foreign
                                        exchange. Lebanon's economy made
                                        impressive gains since the launch in
                                        1993 of "Horizon 2000," the
                                        government's $20 billion
                                        reconstruction program. Real GDP
                                        grew 8% in 1994, 7% in 1995, 4% in
                                        1996 and in 1997 but slowed to 2% in
                                        1998, -1% in 1999, and -0.5% in
                                        2000. Growth recovered slightly in
                                        2001 to 1%. During the 1990s annual
                                        inflation fell to almost 0% from
                                        more than 100%. Lebanon has rebuilt
                                        much of its war-torn physical and
                                        financial infrastructure. The
                                        government nonetheless faces serious
                                        challenges in the economic arena. It
                                        has funded reconstruction by
                                        borrowing heavily - mostly from
                                        domestic banks. The re-installed
                                        HARIRI government has failed to rein
                                        in the ballooning national debt.
                                        Without large-scale international
                                        aid and rapid privatization of
                                        state-owned enterprises, markets may
                                        force a currency devaluation and
                                        debt default in 2002.
