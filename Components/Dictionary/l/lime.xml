      <WordDefinition>Lime
   The Hebrew word so rendered means "boiling" or "effervescing."
   From Isa. 33:12 it appears that lime was made in a kiln lighted
   by thorn-bushes. In Amos 2:1 it is recorded that the king of
   Moab "burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime." The same
   Hebrew word is used in Deut. 27:2-4, and is there rendered
   "plaster." Limestone is the chief constituent of the mountains
   of Syria.
