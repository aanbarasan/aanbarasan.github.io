      <WordDefinition>Loan
   The Mosaic law required that when an Israelite needed to borrow,
   what he asked was to be freely lent to him, and no interest was
   to be charged, although interest might be taken of a foreigner
   (Ex. 22:25; Deut. 23:19, 20; Lev. 25:35-38). At the end of seven
   years all debts were remitted. Of a foreigner the loan might,
   however, be exacted. At a later period of the Hebrew
   commonwealth, when commerce increased, the practice of exacting
   usury or interest on loans, and of suretiship in the commercial
   sense, grew up. Yet the exaction of it from a Hebrew was
   regarded as discreditable (Ps. 15:5; Prov. 6:1, 4; 11:15; 17:18;
   20:16; 27:13; Jer. 15:10).
   
     Limitations are prescribed by the law to the taking of a
   pledge from the borrower. The outer garment in which a man slept
   at night, if taken in pledge, was to be returned before sunset
   (Ex. 22:26, 27; Deut. 24:12, 13). A widow's garment (Deut.
   24:17) and a millstone (6) could not be taken. A creditor could
   not enter the house to reclaim a pledge, but must remain outside
   till the borrower brought it (10, 11). The Hebrew debtor could
   not be retained in bondage longer than the seventh year, or at
   farthest the year of jubilee (Ex. 21:2; Lev. 25:39, 42), but
   foreign sojourners were to be "bondmen for ever" (Lev.
   25:44-54).
