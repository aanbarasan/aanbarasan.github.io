      <WordDefinition>loop
     
        &lt;programming&gt; A sequence of {instructions} that the
        {processor} repeats, either until some condition is met, or
        indefinitely.
     
        In an {structured language} (e.g. {C}, {Pascal}, {BASIC}, or
        {Fortran}), a loop is usually achieved with {for loop}, {while
        loop} or {repeat loop} constructs.
     
        In other languages these constructs may be synthesised with a
        {jump} ({assembly language}) or a {GOTO} (early Fortran or
        BASIC).
