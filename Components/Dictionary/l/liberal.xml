      <WordDefinition>Liberal \Lib"er*al\ (l[i^]b"[~e]r*al), a. [F. lib['e]ral, L.
   liberalis, from liber free; perh. akin to libet, lubet, it
   pleases, E. lief. Cf. {Deliver}.]
   1. Free by birth; hence, befitting a freeman or gentleman;
      refined; noble; independent; free; not servile or mean;
      as, a liberal ancestry; a liberal spirit; liberal arts or

      tongue.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

      generous; bounteous; open-handed; as, a liberal giver. ``
      Liberal of praise.'' --Bacon.
      [1913 Webster]

            Infinitely good, and of his good
            As liberal and free as infinite.      --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Bestowed in a large way; hence, more than sufficient;
      abundant; bountiful; ample; profuse; as, a liberal gift; a
      liberal discharge of matter or of water.
      [1913 Webster]

            His wealth doth warrant a liberal dower. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. Not strict or rigorous; not confined or restricted to the
      literal sense; free; as, a liberal translation of a
      classic, or a liberal construction of law or of language.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. Not narrow or contracted in mind; not selfish; enlarged in
      spirit; catholic.
      [1913 Webster]

   6. Free to excess; regardless of law or moral restraint;

   7. Not bound by orthodox tenets or established forms in

      not conservative; friendly to great freedom in the
      constitution or administration of government; having
      tendency toward democratic or republican, as distinguished
      from monarchical or aristocratic, forms; as, liberal

      [1913 Webster]

            I confess I see nothing liberal in this `` order of
            thoughts,'' as Hobbes elsewhere expresses it.
                                                  --Hazlitt.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Liberal has of, sometimes with, before the thing
         bestowed, in before a word signifying action, and to
         before a person or object on which anything is
         bestowed; as, to be liberal of praise or censure;
         liberal with money; liberal in giving; liberal to the
         poor.
         [1913 Webster]

   {The liberal arts}. See under {Art}.

   {Liberal education}, education that enlarges and disciplines
      the mind and makes it master of its own powers,
      irrespective of the particular business or profession one
      may follow.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Generous; bountiful; munificent; beneficent; ample;
        large; profuse; free.

   Usage: {Liberal}, {Generous}. Liberal is freeborn, and
          generous is highborn. The former is opposed to the
          ordinary feelings of a servile state, and implies
          largeness of spirit in giving, judging, acting, etc.
          The latter expresses that nobleness of soul which is
          peculiarly appropriate to those of high rank, -- a
          spirit that goes out of self, and finds its enjoyment
          in consulting the feelings and happiness of others.
          Generosity is measured by the extent of the sacrifices
          it makes; liberality, by the warmth of feeling which
          it manifests.
          [1913 Webster]
