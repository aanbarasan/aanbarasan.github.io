      <WordDefinition>Levy
   (1 Kings 4:6, R.V.; 5:13), forced service. The service of
   tributaries was often thus exacted by kings. Solomon raised a
   "great levy" of 30,000 men, about two per cent. of the
   population, to work for him by courses on Lebanon. Adoram
   (12:18) presided over this forced labour service (Ger.
   Frohndienst; Fr. corvee).
