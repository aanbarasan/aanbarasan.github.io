      <WordDefinition>Leviticus
   the third book of the Pentateuch; so called in the Vulgate,
   after the LXX., because it treats chiefly of the Levitical
   service.
   
     In the first section of the book (1-17), which exhibits the
   worship itself, there is, (1.) A series of laws (1-7) regarding
   sacrifices, burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and thank-offerings
   (1-3), sin-offerings and trespass-offerings (4; 5), followed by
   the law of the priestly duties in connection with the offering
   of sacrifices (6; 7). (2.) An historical section (8-10), giving
   an account of the consecration of Aaron and his sons (8);
   Aaron's first offering for himself and the people (9); Nadab and
   Abihu's presumption in offering "strange fire before Jehovah,"
   and their punishment (10). (3.) Laws concerning purity, and the
   sacrifices and ordinances for putting away impurity (11-16). An
   interesting fact may be noted here. Canon Tristram, speaking of
   the remarkable discoveries regarding the flora and fauna of the
   Holy Land by the Palestine Exploration officers, makes the
   following statement:, "Take these two catalogues of the clean
   and unclean animals in the books of Leviticus [11] and
   Deuteronomy [14]. There are eleven in Deuteronomy which do not
   occur in Leviticus, and these are nearly all animals and birds
   which are not found in Egypt or the Holy Land, but which are
   numerous in the Arabian desert. They are not named in Leviticus
   a few weeks after the departure from Egypt; but after the people
   were thirty-nine years in the desert they are named, a strong
   proof that the list in Deuteronomy was written at the end of the
   journey, and the list in Leviticus at the beginning. It fixes
   the writing of that catalogue to one time and period only, viz.,
   that when the children of Israel were familiar with the fauna
   and the flora of the desert" (Palest. Expl. Quart., Jan. 1887).
   (4.) Laws marking the separation between Israel and the heathen
   (17-20). (5.) Laws about the personal purity of the priests, and
   their eating of the holy things (20; 21); about the offerings of
   Israel, that they were to be without blemish (22:17-33); and
   about the due celebration of the great festivals (23; 25). (6.)
   Then follow promises and warnings to the people regarding
   obedience to these commandments, closing with a section on vows.
   
     The various ordinances contained in this book were all
   delivered in the space of a month (comp. Ex. 40:17; Num. 1:1),
   the first month of the second year after the Exodus. It is the
   third book of Moses.
   
     No book contains more of the very words of God. He is almost
   throughout the whole of it the direct speaker. This book is a
   prophecy of things to come, a shadow whereof the substance is
   Christ and his kingdom. The principles on which it is to be
   interpreted are laid down in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It
   contains in its complicated ceremonial the gospel of the grace
   of God.
