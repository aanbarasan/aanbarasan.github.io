      <WordDefinition>Left-handed
   (Judg. 3:15; 20:16), one unable to use the right hand skilfully,
   and who therefore uses the left; and also one who uses the left
   as well as the right, ambidexter. Such a condition of the hands
   is due to physical causes. This quality was common apparently in
   the tribe of Benjamin.
