      <WordDefinition>LAST, n.  A shoemaker's implement, named by a frowning Providence as
opportunity to the maker of puns.

        Where the cobbler is unknown,
    So that I might forget his last
        And hear your own.

          last commonly implies that something has occurred (as
          interruptions, disappointments, etc.) which leads us
          to emphasize the idea of having reached the end; as,
          in spite of every obstacle, we have at last arrived.
