      <WordDefinition>Larva \Lar"va\ (l[aum]r"v[.a]), n.; pl. L. {Larv[ae]}
   (l[aum]r"v[ae]), E. {Larvas} (l[aum]r"v[.a]z). [L. larva
   ghost, specter, mask.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) Any young insect from the time that it hatches
      from the egg until it becomes a pupa, or chrysalis. During
      this time it usually molts several times, and may change
      its form or color each time. The larv[ae] of many insects
      are much like the adults in form and habits, but have no
      trace of wings, the rudimentary wings appearing only in
      the pupa stage. In other groups of insects the larv[ae]
      are totally unlike the parents in structure and habits,
      and are called {caterpillars}, {grubs}, {maggots}, etc.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Zo["o]l.) The early, immature form of any animal when
      more or less of a metamorphosis takes place, before the
      assumption of the mature shape.
      [1913 Webster]
