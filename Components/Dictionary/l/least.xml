   {Least squares} (Math.), a method of deducing from a number
      of carefully made yet slightly discordant observations of
      a phenomenon the most probable values of the unknown
      quantities.

         probable values are those which make the sum of the
         squares of the residual errors of the observation a
         minimum.
