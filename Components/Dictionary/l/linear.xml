            Linear thinkers concluded that by taking the world
            apart, the actions of people were more predictable
            and controllable.                     --David Morris
                                                  (Conference
                                                  presentation,
                                                  Fairfield

   {Linear differential equation} (Math.), an equation which is
      of the first degree, when the expression which is equated
      to zero is regarded as a function of the dependent
      variable and its differential coefficients.

   {Linear equation} (Math.), an equation of the first degree
      between two variables; -- so called because every such
      equation may be considered as representing a right line.
      

   {Linear measure}, the measurement of length.

   {Linear numbers} (Math.), such numbers as have relation to
      length only: such is a number which represents one side of
      a plane figure. If the plane figure is square, the linear
      figure is called a root.

   {Linear problem} (Geom.), a problem which may be solved
      geometrically by the use of right lines alone.

   {Linear transformation} (Alg.), a change of variables where
      each variable is replaced by a function of the first
      degree in the new variable.
