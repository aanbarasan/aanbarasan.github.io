      <WordDefinition>Lottery \Lot"ter*y\, n.; pl. {Lotteries}. [Lot + -ery, as in
   brewery, bindery.]
   1. A scheme for the distribution of prizes by lot or chance;
      esp., a gaming scheme in which one or more tickets bearing
      particular numbers draw prizes, and the rest of the
      tickets are blanks. Fig.: An affair of chance.

         make private lotteries illegal, except in certain
         circumstances for charitable institutions; however,
         many of the states now conduct lotteries tehmselves as
         a revenue source.
