      <WordDefinition>Learn \Learn\ (l[~e]rn), v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Learned}
   (l[~e]rnd), or {Learnt} (l[~e]rnt); p. pr. &amp; vb. n.
   {Learning}.] [OE. lernen, leornen, AS. leornian; akin to OS.
   lin[=o]n, for lirn[=o]n, OHG. lirn[=e]n, lern[=e]n, G.
   lernen, fr. the root of AS. l[=ae]ran to teach, OS.
   l[=e]rian, OHG. l[=e]ran, G. lehren, Goth. laisjan, also Goth
   lais I know, leis acquainted (in comp.); all prob. from a
   root meaning, to go, go over, and hence, to learn; cf. AS.
   leoran to go. Cf. {Last} a mold of the foot, {lore}.]
   1. To gain knowledge or information of; to ascertain by
      inquiry, study, or investigation; to receive instruction
      concerning; to fix in the mind; to acquire understanding
      of, or skill; as, to learn the way; to learn a lesson; to
      learn dancing; to learn to skate; to learn the violin; to
      learn the truth about something. ``Learn to do well.''
      --Is. i. 17.
      [1913 Webster]

            Now learn a parable of the fig tree.  --Matt. xxiv.
                                                  32.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. To communicate knowledge to; to teach. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

            Hast thou not learned me how
            To make perfumes ?                    --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Learn formerly had also the sense of teach, in
         accordance with the analogy of the French and other
         languages, and hence we find it with this sense in
         Shakespeare, Spenser, and other old writers. This usage
         has now passed away. To learn is to receive
         instruction, and to teach is to give instruction. He
         who is taught learns, not he who teaches.
         [1913 Webster]
