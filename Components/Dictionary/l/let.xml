      <WordDefinition>Let \Let\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Let} ({Letted} (l[e^]t"t[e^]d),
   [Obs].); p. pr. &amp; vb. n. {Letting}.] [OE. leten, l[ae]ten
   (past tense lat, let, p. p. laten, leten, lete), AS.
   l[=ae]tan (past tense l[=e]t, p. p. l[=ae]ten); akin to
   OFries. l[=e]ta, OS. l[=a]tan, D. laten, G. lassen, OHG.
   l[=a]zzan, Icel. l[=a]ta, Sw. l[*a]ta, Dan. lade, Goth.
   l[=e]tan, and L. lassus weary. The original meaning seems to
   have been, to let loose, let go, let drop. Cf. {Alas},
   {Late}, {Lassitude}, {Let} to hinder.]
   1. To leave; to relinquish; to abandon. [Obs. or Archaic,
      except when followed by alone or be.]
      [1913 Webster]

      [1913 Webster]

   2. To consider; to think; to esteem. [Obs.] --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. To cause; to make; -- used with the infinitive in the
      active form but in the passive sense; as, let make, i. e.,
      cause to be made; let bring, i. e., cause to be brought.
      [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

            This irous, cursed wretch
            Let this knight's son anon before him fetch.
                                                  --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

      [1913 Webster]

            Anon he let two coffers make.         --Gower.

   4. To permit; to allow; to suffer; -- either affirmatively,
      by positive act, or negatively, by neglecting to restrain
      or prevent.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In this sense, when followed by an infinitive, the
         latter is commonly without the sign to; as to let us
         walk, i. e., to permit or suffer us to walk. Sometimes
         there is entire omission of the verb; as, to let [to be
         or to go] loose.
         [1913 Webster]

               Pharaoh said, I will let you go.   --Ex. viii.
                                                  28.
         [1913 Webster]

   6. To give, grant, or assign, as a work, privilege, or
      contract; -- often with out; as, to let the building of a
      bridge; to let out the lathing and the plastering.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The active form of the infinitive of let, as of many
         other English verbs, is often used in a passive sense;
         as, a house to let (i. e., for letting, or to be let).
         This form of expression conforms to the use of the
         Anglo-Saxon gerund with to (dative infinitive) which
         was commonly so employed. See {Gerund}, 2. `` Your
         elegant house in Harley Street is to let.''
         --Thackeray. In the imperative mood, before the first
         person plural, let has a hortative force. `` Rise up,
         let us go.'' --Mark xiv. 42. `` Let us seek out some
         desolate shade.'' --Shak.
