        1. What a hacker subjected to formal management training is
        said to have undergone.  At {IBM} and elsewhere this term is
        used by both hackers and low-level management; the latter
        doubtless intend it as a joke.
     
        2. The act of removing the processor from a {microcomputer} in
        order to replace or upgrade it.  Some very cheap {clone}
        systems are sold in "lobotomised" form - everything but the
        brain.
