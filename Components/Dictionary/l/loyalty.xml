      <WordDefinition>Loyalty \Loy"al*ty\, n. [Cf. F. loyaut['e]. See {Loyal}, and cf.
   {Legality}.]
   The state or quality of being loyal; fidelity to a superior,
   or to duty, love, etc.
   [1913 Webster]

         He had such loyalty to the king as the law required.
                                                  --Clarendon.
   [1913 Webster]

         Not withstanding all the subtle bait
         With which those Amazons his love still craved,
         To his one love his loyalty he saved.    --Spenser.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: ``Loyalty . . . expresses, properly, that fidelity
         which one owes according to law, and does not
         necessarily include that attachment to the royal
         person, which, happily, we in England have been able
         further to throw into the word.'' --Trench.

   Syn: Allegiance; fealty. See {Allegiance}.
        [1913 Webster]
