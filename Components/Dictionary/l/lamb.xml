      <WordDefinition>Lamb
   (1.) Heb. kebes, a male lamb from the first to the third year.
   Offered daily at the morning and the evening sacrifice (Ex.
   29:38-42), on the Sabbath day (Num. 28:9), at the feast of the
   New Moon (28:11), of Trumpets (29:2), of Tabernacles (13-40), of
   Pentecost (Lev. 23:18-20), and of the Passover (Ex. 12:5), and
   on many other occasions (1 Chr. 29:21; 2 Chr. 29:21; Lev. 9:3;
   14:10-25).
   
     (2.) Heb. taleh, a young sucking lamb (1 Sam. 7:9; Isa.
   65:25). In the symbolical language of Scripture the lamb is the
   type of meekness and innocence (Isa. 11:6; 65:25; Luke 10:3;
   John 21:15).
   
     The lamb was a symbol of Christ (Gen. 4:4; Ex. 12:3; 29:38;
   Isa. 16:1; 53:7; John 1:36; Rev. 13:8).
   
     Christ is called the Lamb of God (John 1:29, 36), as the great
   sacrifice of which the former sacrifices were only types (Num.
   6:12; Lev. 14:12-17; Isa. 53:7; 1 Cor. 5:7).
