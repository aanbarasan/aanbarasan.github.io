      <WordDefinition>lint
     
        A {Unix} {C} language processor which carries out more
        thorough checks on the code than is usual with C {compiler}s.
     
        Lint is named after the bits of fluff it supposedly picks from
        programs.  Judging by references on {Usenet} this term has
        become a shorthand for {desk check} at some non-Unix shops,
        even in languages other than {C}.  Also used as {delint}.

      <WordDefinition>lint [from Unix's `lint(1)', named for the bits of fluff it supposedly
   picks from programs] 1. vt. To examine a program closely for style,
   language usage, and portability problems, esp. if in C, esp. if via use
   of automated analysis tools, most esp. if the Unix utility `lint(1)' is
   used. This term used to be restricted to use of `lint(1)' itself, but
   (judging by references on Usenet) it has become a shorthand for {desk
   check} at some non-Unix shops, even in languages other than C. Also as
   v. {delint}. 2. n. Excess verbiage in a document, as in "This draft has
   too much lint".
