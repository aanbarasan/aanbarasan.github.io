   akin to Fries. l[=e]tza, OHG. l[=a]hh[=i], Icel. l[ae]knari,
   Sw. l["a]kare, Dan. l[ae]ge, Goth. l[=e]keis, AS. l[=a]cnian
   to heal, Sw. l["a]ka, Dan. l[ae]ge, Icel. l[ae]kna, Goth.
   l[=e]kin[=o]n.]
   1. A physician or surgeon; a professor of the art of healing.
      [Written also {leach}.] [Archaic] --Spenser.
      [1913 Webster]

            Leech, heal thyself.                  --Wyclif (Luke
                                                  iv. 23).

   2. (Zo["o]l.) Any one of numerous genera and species of
      annulose worms, belonging to the order {Hirudinea}, or
      Bdelloidea, esp. those species used in medicine, as
      {Hirudo medicinalis} of Europe, and allied species.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In the mouth of bloodsucking leeches are three
         convergent, serrated jaws, moved by strong muscles. By
         the motion of these jaws a stellate incision is made in
         the skin, through which the leech sucks blood till it
         is gorged, and then drops off. The stomach has large
         pouches on each side to hold the blood. The common
         large bloodsucking leech of America ({Macrobdella
         decora}) is dark olive above, and red below, with black
         spots. Many kinds of leeches are parasitic on fishes;
         others feed upon worms and mollusks, and have no jaws
         for drawing blood. See {Bdelloidea}. {Hirudinea}, and
         {Clepsine}.
         [1913 Webster]

   3. (Surg.) A glass tube of peculiar construction, adapted for
      drawing blood from a scarified part by means of a vacuum.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Horse leech}, a less powerful European leech ({H[ae]mopis
      vorax}), commonly attacking the membrane that lines the
      inside of the mouth and nostrils of animals that drink at
      pools where it lives.

      <WordDefinition>leech 1. n. (Also `leecher'.) Among BBS types, crackers and {warez
   d00dz}, one who consumes knowledge without generating new software,
   cracks, or techniques. BBS culture specifically defines a leech as
   someone who downloads files with few or no uploads in return, and who
   does not contribute to the message section. Cracker culture extends this
   definition to someone (a {lamer}, usually) who constantly presses
   informed sources for information and/or assistance, but has nothing to
   contribute. 2. v. [common, Toronto area] To instantly fetch a file
   (other than a mail attachment) whether by FTP or IRC file req or any
   other method. Seems to be a holdover from the early 1990s when Toronto
   had a very active BBS and warez scene.
