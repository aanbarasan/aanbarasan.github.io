      <WordDefinition>Leaf
   of a tree. The olive-leaf mentioned Gen. 8:11. The barren
   fig-tree had nothing but leaves (Matt. 21:19; Mark 11:13). The
   oak-leaf is mentioned Isa. 1:30; 6:13. There are numerous
   allusions to leaves, their flourishing, their decay, and their
   restoration (Lev. 26:36; Isa. 34:4; Jer. 8:13; Dan. 4:12, 14,
   21; Mark 11:13; 13:28). The fresh leaf is a symbol of prosperity
   (Ps. 1:3; Jer. 17:8; Ezek. 47:12); the faded, of decay (Job
   13:25; Isa. 1:30; 64:6; Jer. 8:13).
   
     Leaf of a door (1 Kings 6:34), the valve of a folding door.
   
     Leaf of a book (Jer. 36:23), perhaps a fold of a roll.

      <WordDefinition>Leaf \Leaf\ (l[=e]f), n.; pl. {Leaves} (l[=e]vz). [OE. leef,
   lef, leaf, AS. le['a]f; akin to S. l[=o]f, OFries. laf, D.
   loof foliage, G. laub, OHG. loub leaf, foliage, Icel. lauf,
   Sw. l["o]f, Dan. l["o]v, Goth. laufs; cf. Lith. lapas. Cf.
   {Lodge}.]
   1. (Bot.) A colored, usually green, expansion growing from
      the side of a stem or rootstock, in which the sap for the
      use of the plant is elaborated under the influence of
      light; one of the parts of a plant which collectively
      constitute its foliage.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Such leaves usually consist of a blade, or lamina,
         supported upon a leafstalk or petiole, which, continued
         through the blade as the midrib, gives off woody ribs
         and veins that support the cellular texture. The
         petiole has usually some sort of an appendage on each
         side of its base, which is called the stipule. The
         green parenchyma of the leaf is covered with a thin
         epiderm pierced with closable microscopic openings,
         known as stomata.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. (Bot.) A special organ of vegetation in the form of a
      lateral outgrowth from the stem, whether appearing as a
      part of the foliage, or as a cotyledon, a scale, a bract,
      a spine, or a tendril.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In this view every part of a plant, except the root and
         the stem, is either a leaf, or is composed of leaves
         more or less modified and transformed.
         [1913 Webster]

          upon its opposite sides.

          as of window shutters, folding doors, etc.
      (c) The movable side of a table.
      (d) A very thin plate; as, gold leaf.
