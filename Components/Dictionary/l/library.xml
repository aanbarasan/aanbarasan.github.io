      <WordDefinition>library
     
        &lt;programming, library&gt; A collection of {subroutines} and
        {functions} stored in one or more files, usually in compiled
        form, for linking with other programs.  Libraries are one of
        the earliest forms of organised {code reuse}.  They are often
        supplied by the {operating system} or {software development
        environment} developer to be used in many different programs.
        The routines in a library may be general purpose or designed
        for some specific function such as three dimensional animated
        graphics.
     
        Libraries are linked with the user's program to form a
        complete {executable}.  The linking may be {static linking}
        or, in some systems, {dynamic linking}.
