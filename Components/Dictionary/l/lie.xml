      <WordDefinition>Lie
   an intentional violation of the truth. Lies are emphatically
   condemned in Scripture (John 8:44; 1 Tim. 1:9, 10; Rev. 21:27;
   22:15). Mention is made of the lies told by good men, as by
   Abraham (Gen. 12:12, 13; 20:2), Isaac (26:7), and Jacob (27:24);
   also by the Hebrew midwives (Ex. 1:15-19), by Michal (1 Sam.
   19:14), and by David (1 Sam. 20:6). (See {ANANIAS}.)

      <WordDefinition>Lie \Lie\ (l[imac]), n. [AS. lyge; akin to D. leugen, OHG. lugi,
   G. l["u]ge, lug, Icel. lygi, Dan. &amp; Sw. l["o]gn, Goth. liugn.
   See {Lie} to utter a falsehood.]
   1. A falsehood uttered or acted for the purpose of deception;
      an intentional violation of truth; an untruth spoken with
      the intention to deceive.
      [1913 Webster]

            The proper notion of a lie is an endeavoring to
            deceive another by signifying that to him as true,
            which we ourselves think not to be so. --S. Clarke.
      [1913 Webster]

            It is willful deceit that makes a lie. A man may act
            a lie, as by pointing his finger in a wrong
            direction when a traveler inquires of him his road.
                                                  --Paley.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. A fiction; a fable; an untruth. --Dryden.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Anything which misleads or disappoints.
      [1913 Webster]

            Wishing this lie of life was o'er.    --Trench.
      [1913 Webster]

   {To give the lie to}.
      (a) To charge with falsehood; as, the man gave him the
          lie.
      (b) To reveal to be false; as, a man's actions may give
          the lie to his words.

   {White lie}, a euphemism for such lies as one finds it
      convenient to tell, and excuses himself for telling.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Untruth; falsehood; fiction; deception.

   Usage: {Lie}, {Untruth}. A man may state what is untrue from
          ignorance or misconception; hence, to impute an
          untruth to one is not necessarily the same as charging
          him with a lie. Every lie is an untruth, but not every
          untruth is a lie. Cf. {Falsity}.

      maintained. ``An appeal lies in this case.'' --Parsons.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Through ignorance or carelessness speakers and writers
         often confuse the forms of the two distinct verbs lay
         and lie. Lay is a transitive verb, and has for its
         preterit laid; as, he told me to lay it down, and I
         laid it down. Lie is intransitive, and has for its
         preterit lay; as, he told me to lie down, and I lay
         down. Some persons blunder by using laid for the
         preterit of lie; as, he told me to lie down, and I laid
         down. So persons often say incorrectly, the ship laid
         at anchor; they laid by during the storm; the book was
         laying on the shelf, etc. It is only necessary to
         remember, in all such cases, that laid is the preterit
         of lay, and not of lie.
         [1913 Webster]
