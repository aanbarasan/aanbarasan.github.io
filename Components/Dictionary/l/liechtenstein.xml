   Introduction Liechtenstein
   --------------------------
                            Background: The Principality of Liechtenstein
                                        was established within the Holy
                                        Roman Empire in 1719; it became a
                                        sovereign state in 1806. Until the
                                        end of World War I, it was closely
                                        tied to Austria, but the economic
                                        devastation caused by that conflict
                                        forced Liechtenstein to conclude a
                                        customs and monetary union with
                                        Switzerland. Since World War II (in
                                        which Liechtenstein remained
                                        neutral) the country's low taxes
                                        have spurred outstanding economic
                                        growth. However, shortcomings in
                                        banking regulatory oversight have
                                        resulted in concerns about the use
                                        of the financial institutions for
                                        money laundering.

   Economy Liechtenstein
   ---------------------
                    Economy - overview: Despite its small size and limited
                                        natural resources, Liechtenstein has
                                        developed into a prosperous, highly
                                        industrialized, free-enterprise
                                        economy with a vital financial
                                        service sector and living standards
                                        on a par with the urban areas of its
                                        large European neighbors. Low
                                        business taxes - the maximum tax
                                        rate is 18% - and easy incorporation
                                        rules have induced 73,700 holding or
                                        so-called letter box companies to
                                        establish nominal offices in
                                        Liechtenstein, providing 30% of
                                        state revenues. The country
                                        participates in a customs union with
                                        Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc
                                        as its national currency. It imports
                                        more than 90% of its energy
                                        requirements. Liechtenstein has been
                                        a member of the European Economic
                                        Area (an organization serving as a
