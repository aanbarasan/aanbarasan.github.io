      <WordDefinition>latch
     
        A digital logic circuit used to store one or more bits.  A
        latch has a data input, a clock input and an output.  When the
        clock input is active, data on the input is "latched" or
        stored and transfered to the output either immediately or when
        the clock input goes inactive.  The output will then retain
        its value until the clock goes active again.
     
        See also {flip-flop}.
