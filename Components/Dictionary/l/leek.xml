      <WordDefinition>Leek
   (Heb. hatsir; the Allium porrum), rendered "grass" in 1 Kings
   18:5, 2 Kings 19:26, Job 40:15, etc.; "herb" in Job 8:12; "hay"
   in Prov. 27:25, and Isa. 15:6; "leeks" only in Num. 11:5. This
   Hebrew word seems to denote in this last passage simply herbs,
   such as lettuce or savoury herbs cooked as kitchen vegetables,
   and not necessarily what are now called leeks. The leek was a
   favourite vegetable in Egypt, and is still largely cultivated
   there and in Palestine.
