      <WordDefinition>Nathan
   given. (1.) A prophet in the reigns of David and Solomon (2 Chr.
   9:29). He is first spoken of in connection with the arrangements
   David made for the building of the temple (2 Sam. 7:2, 3, 17),
   and next appears as the reprover of David on account of his sin
   with Bathsheba (12:1-14). He was charged with the education of
   Solomon (12:25), at whose inauguration to the throne he took a
   prominent part (1 Kings 1:8, 10, 11, 22-45). His two sons, Zabad
   (1 Chr. 2:36) and Azariah (1 Kings 4:5) occupied places of
   honour at the king's court. He last appears in assisting David
   in reorganizing the public worship (2 Chr. 29:25). He seems to
   have written a life of David, and also a life of Solomon (1 Chr.
   29:29; 2 Chr. 9:29).
   
     (2.) A son of David, by Bathsheba (2 Sam. 5:14), whose name
   appears in the genealogy of Mary, the mother of our Lord (Luke
   3:31).
   
     (3.) Ezra 8:16.
