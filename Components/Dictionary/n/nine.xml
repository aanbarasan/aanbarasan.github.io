   {Nine points circle} (Geom.), a circle so related to any
      given triangle as to pass through the three points in
      which the perpendiculars from the angles of the triangle
      upon the opposite sides (or the sides produced) meet the
      sides. It also passes through the three middle points of
      the sides of the triangle and through the three middle
      points of those parts of the perpendiculars that are
      between their common point of meeting and the angles of
      the triangle. The circle is hence called the {nine points
      circle} or {six points circle}.
