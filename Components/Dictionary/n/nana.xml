      <WordDefinition>NANA // [Usenet] The newsgroups news.admin.net-abuse.*, devoted to
   fighting {spam} and network abuse. Each individual newsgroup is often
   referred to by adding a letter to NANA. For example, NANAU would refer
   to news.admin.net-abuse.usenet.

   When spam began to be a serious problem around 1995, and a loose
   network of anti-spammers formed to combat it, spammers immediately
   accused them of being the {backbone cabal}, or the Cabal reborn. Though
   this was not true, spam-fighters ironically accepted the label and the
   tag line "There is No Cabal" reappeared (later, and now commonly,
   abbreviated to "TINC"). Nowadays "the Cabal" is generally understood to
   refer to the NANA regulars.
