        /nan'oh/ 1. &lt;unit&gt; A {prefix} meaning 10^-9 or one billionth.
     
        Used loosely to mean "small", e.g. {nanotechnology}, or
        (rarely), following "nanosecond", to mean a short time,
        e.g. "I'll be with you in a nano".

      smaller than those that would be referred to as {micro-};
      as, nanoscale manipulations.

      <WordDefinition>nano /nan'oh/ n. [CMU: from `nanosecond'] A brief period of time. "Be
   with you in a nano" means you really will be free shortly, i.e., implies
   what mainstream people mean by "in a jiffy" (whereas the hackish use of
   `jiffy' is quite different -- see {jiffy}).

      <WordDefinition>nano- pref. [SI: the next quantifier below {micro-}; meaning * 10^(-9)]
   Smaller than {micro-}, and used in the same rather loose and connotative
   way. Thus, one has {{nanotechnology}} (coined by hacker K. Eric Drexler)
   by analogy with `microtechnology'; and a few machine architectures have
   a `nanocode' level below `microcode'. Tom Duff at Bell Labs has also
   pointed out that "Pi seconds is a nanocentury". See also
   {{quantifiers}}, {pico-}, {nanoacre}, {nanobot}, {nanocomputer},
   {nanofortnight}.
