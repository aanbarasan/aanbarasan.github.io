      <WordDefinition>Nail
   for fastening. (1.) Hebrew yathed, "piercing," a peg or nail of
   any material (Ezek. 15:3), more especially a tent-peg (Ex.
   27:19; 35:18; 38:20), with one of which Jael (q.v.) pierced the
   temples of Sisera (Judg. 4:21, 22). This word is also used
   metaphorically (Zech. 10:4) for a prince or counsellor, just as
   "the battle-bow" represents a warrior.
   
     (2.) Masmer, a "point," the usual word for a nail. The words
   of the wise are compared to "nails fastened by the masters of
   assemblies" (Eccl. 12:11, A.V.). The Revised Version reads, "as
   nails well fastened are the words of the masters," etc. Others
   (as Plumptre) read, "as nails fastened are the masters of
   assemblies" (comp. Isa. 22:23; Ezra 9:8). David prepared nails
   for the temple (1 Chr. 22:3; 2 Chr. 3:9). The nails by which our
   Lord was fixed to the cross are mentioned (John 20:25; Col.
   2:14).
   
     Nail of the finger (Heb. tsipporen, "scraping"). To "pare the
   nails" is in Deut. 21:12 (marg., "make," or "dress," or "suffer
   to grow") one of the signs of purification, separation from
   former heathenism (comp. Lev. 14:8; Num. 8:7). In Jer. 17:1 this
   word is rendered "point."

         roseheads, diamonds, fourpenny, tenpenny (see {Penny},
         a.), chiselpointed, cut, wrought, or wire nails, etc.
