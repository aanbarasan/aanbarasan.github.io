   in use among the Hebrews for fishing, hunting, and fowling. The
   fishing-net was probably constructed after the form of that used
   by the Egyptians (Isa. 19:8). There were three kinds of nets.
   (1.) The drag-net or hauling-net (Gr. sagene), of great size,
   and requiring many men to work it. It was usually let down from
   the fishing-boat, and then drawn to the shore or into the boat,
   as circumstances might require (Matt. 13:47, 48). (2.) The
   hand-net or casting-net (Gr. amphiblestron), which was thrown
   from a rock or a boat at any fish that might be seen (Matt.
   4:18; Mark 1:16). It was called by the Latins funda. It was of
   circular form, "like the top of a tent." (3.) The bag-net (Gr.
   diktyon), used for enclosing fish in deep water (Luke 5:4-9).
   
     The fowling-nets were (1) the trap, consisting of a net spread
   over a frame, and supported by a stick in such a way that it
   fell with the slightest touch (Amos 3:5, "gin;" Ps. 69:22; Job
   18:9; Eccl. 9:12). (2) The snare, consisting of a cord to catch
   birds by the leg (Job 18:10; Ps. 18:5; 116:3; 140:5). (3.) The
   decoy, a cage filled with birds as decoys (Jer. 5:26, 27).
   Hunting-nets were much in use among the Hebrews.
