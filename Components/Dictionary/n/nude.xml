      <WordDefinition>nude
     
        Said of machines delivered without an operating system
        (compare {bare metal}).  "We ordered 50 systems, but they all
        arrived nude, so we had to spend a an extra weekend with the
        installation tapes."  This usage is a recent innovation
        reflecting the fact that most PC clones are now delivered with
        DOS or Microsoft Windows pre-installed at the factory.  Other
        kinds of hardware are still normally delivered without OS, so
        this term is particular to PC support groups.

   factory. Other kinds of hardware are still normally delivered without
   OS, so this term is particular to PC support groups.
