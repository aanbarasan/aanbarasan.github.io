      <WordDefinition>Needle
   used only in the proverb, "to pass through a needle's eye"
   (Matt. 19:24; Mark 10:25; Luke 18:25). Some interpret the
   expression as referring to the side gate, close to the principal
   gate, usually called the "eye of a needle" in the East; but it
   is rather to be taken literally. The Hebrew females were skilled
   in the use of the needle (Ex. 28:39; 26:36; Judg. 5:30).
