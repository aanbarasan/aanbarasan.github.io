   Introduction Norway
   -------------------
                            Background: Despite its neutrality, Norway was
                                        not able to avoid occupation by
                                        Germany in World War II. In 1949,
                                        neutrality was abandoned and Norway
                                        became a member of NATO. Discovery
                                        of oil and gas in adjacent waters in
                                        the late 1960s boosted Norway's
                                        economic fortunes. The current focus
                                        is on containing spending on the
                                        extensive welfare system and
                                        planning for the time when petroleum
                                        reserves are depleted. In referenda
                                        held in 1972 and 1994, Norway
                                        rejected joining the EU.

   Economy Norway
   --------------
                    Economy - overview: The Norwegian economy is a
                                        prosperous bastion of welfare
                                        capitalism, featuring a combination
                                        of free market activity and
                                        government intervention. The
                                        government controls key areas, such
                                        as the vital petroleum sector
                                        (through large-scale state
                                        enterprises). The country is richly
                                        endowed with natural resources -
                                        petroleum, hydropower, fish,
                                        forests, and minerals - and is
                                        highly dependent on its oil
                                        production and international oil
                                        prices; in 1999, oil and gas
                                        accounted for 35% of exports. Only
                                        Saudi Arabia and Russia export more
                                        oil than Norway. Oslo opted to stay
                                        out of the EU during a referendum in
                                        November 1994. Growth picked up in
                                        2000 to 2.7%, compared with the
                                        meager 0.8% of 1999, but fell back
                                        to 1.3% in 2001. The government
                                        moved ahead with privatization in
                                        2000, even proposing the sale of up
                                        to one-third of the 100% state-owned
                                        oil company Statoil. With arguably
                                        the highest quality of life
                                        worldwide, Norwegians still worry
                                        about that time in the next two
                                        decades when the oil and gas begin
                                        to run out. Accordingly, Norway has
                                        been saving its oil-boosted budget
                                        surpluses in a Government Petroleum
                                        Fund, which is invested abroad and
                                        now is valued at more than $43
