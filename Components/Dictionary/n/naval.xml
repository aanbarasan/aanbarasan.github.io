      <WordDefinition>Naval \Na"val\ (n[=a]"val), a. [L. navalis, fr. navis ship: cf.
   F. naval. See {Nave} of a church.]
   Having to do with shipping; of or pertaining to ships or a
   navy; consisting of ships; as, naval forces, successes,
   stores, etc.
   [1913 Webster]

   {Naval brigade}, a body of seamen or marines organized for
      military service on land.

   Syn: Nautical; marine; maritime.

   Usage: {Naval}, {Nautical}. Naval is applied to vessels, or a
          navy, or the things which pertain to them or in which
          they participate; nautical, to seamen and the art of
          navigation. Hence we speak of a naval, as opposed to a
          military, engagement; naval equipments or stores, a
          naval triumph, a naval officer, etc., and of nautical
          pursuits or instruction, nautical calculations, a
          nautical almanac, etc.
