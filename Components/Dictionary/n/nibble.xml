      <WordDefinition>nibble
     
        &lt;data&gt; /nib'l/ (US "nybble", by analogy with "bite" -&gt; "byte")
        Half a {byte}.  Since a byte is nearly always eight {bits}, a
        nibble is nearly always four bits (and can therefore be
        represented by one {hex} digit).
     
        Other size nibbles have existed, for example the {BBC
        Microcomputer} disk file system used eleven bit sector numbers
        which were described as one byte (eight bits) and a nibble
        (three bits).
     
        Compare {crumb}, {tayste}, {dynner}; see also {bit}, {nickle},
        {deckle}.
     
        The spelling "nybble" is uncommon in {Commonwealth Hackish} as
        British orthography suggests the pronunciation /ni:'bl/.
