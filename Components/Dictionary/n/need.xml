      <WordDefinition>Need \Need\ (n[=e]d), n. [OE. need, neod, nede, AS. ne['a]d,
   n[=y]d; akin to D. nood, G. not, noth, Icel. nau[eth]r, Sw. &amp;
   Dan. n["o]d, Goth. nau[thorn]s.]
   1. A state that requires supply or relief; pressing occasion
      for something; necessity; urgent want.
      [1913 Webster]

            And the city had no need of the sun.  --Rev. xxi.
                                                  23.
      [1913 Webster]

            I have no need to beg.                --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            Be governed by your needs, not by your fancy. --Jer.
                                                  Taylor.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Want of the means of subsistence; poverty; indigence;
      destitution. --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

            Famine is in thy cheeks;
            Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. That which is needful; anything necessary to be done;
      (pl.) necessary things; business. [Obs.] --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. Situation of need; peril; danger. [Obs.] --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Exigency; emergency; strait; extremity; necessity;
        distress; destitution; poverty; indigence; want; penury.

   Usage: {Need}, {Necessity}. Necessity is stronger than need;
          it places us under positive compulsion. We are
          frequently under the necessity of going without that
          of which we stand very greatly in need. It is also
          with the corresponding adjectives; necessitous
          circumstances imply the direct pressure of suffering;
          needy circumstances, the want of aid or relief.

   Note: With another verb, need is used like an auxiliary,
         generally in a negative sentence expressing requirement
         or obligation, and in this use it undergoes no change
         of termination in the third person singular of the
         present tense. ``And the lender need not fear he shall
         be injured.'' --Anacharsis (Trans. ).
