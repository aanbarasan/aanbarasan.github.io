   1. To fasten with a nail or nails; to close up or secure by
      means of nails; as, to nail boards to the beams.

      [1913 Webster]

   3. To fasten, as with a nail; to bind or hold, as to a
      bargain or to acquiescence in an argument or assertion;
      hence, to catch; to trap.
      [1913 Webster]

            When they came to talk of places in town, you saw at
            once how I nailed them.               --Goldsmith.

   {To nail an assertion} or {To nail a lie}, etc., to detect
      and expose it, so as to put a stop to its currency; -- an
      expression probably derived from the former practice of
      shopkeepers, who were accustomed to nail bad or
      counterfeit pieces of money to the counter.
      [1913 Webster]
