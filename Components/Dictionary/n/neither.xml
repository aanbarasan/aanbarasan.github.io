   Note: Neither was formerly often used where we now use nor.
         ``For neither circumcision, neither uncircumcision is
         anything at all.'' --Tyndale. ``Ye shall not eat of it,
         neither shall ye touch it.'' --Gen. iii. 3. Neither is
         sometimes used colloquially at the end of a clause to
         enforce a foregoing negative (nor, not, no). ``He is
         very tall, but not too tall neither.'' --Addison. '' `I
         care not for his thrust' `No, nor I neither.''' --Shak.

   {Not so neither}, by no means. [Obs.] --Shak.
