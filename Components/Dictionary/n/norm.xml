      <WordDefinition>norm
     
        &lt;mathematics&gt; A real-valued function modelling the length of a
        {vector}.  The norm must be {homogeneous} and {symmetric} and
        fulfil the following condition: the shortest way to reach a
        point is to go straight toward it.  Every {convex} symmetric
        {closed} surface surrounding point 0 introduces a norm by
        means of {Minkowski functional}; all vectors that end on the
        surface have the same norm then.
     
        The most popular norm is the {Euclidean norm}; it is
        calculated by summing up squares of all coordinates and taking
        the square root; this is the essence of {Pythagorus's
        theorem}.  In the infinite-dimensional case, the sum is
        infinite or is replaced with an integral when the number of
        dimensions is {uncountable}.
