      <WordDefinition>Neck
   used sometimes figuratively. To "lay down the neck" (Rom. 16:4)
   is to hazard one's life. Threatenings of coming judgments are
   represented by the prophets by their laying bands upon the
   people's necks (Deut. 28:48; Isa. 10:27; Jer. 27:2). Conquerors
   put their feet on the necks of their enemies as a sign of their
   subjection (Josh. 10:24; 2 Sam. 22:41).
