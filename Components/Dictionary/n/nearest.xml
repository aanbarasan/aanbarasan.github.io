      <WordDefinition>Near \Near\, a. [Compar. {Nearer}; superl. {Nearest}.] [See
   {Near}, adv.]
   1. Not far distant in time, place, or degree; not remote;
      close at hand; adjacent; neighboring; nigh. ``As one near
      death.'' --Shak.

   2. Closely connected or related.
      [1913 Webster]

            She is thy father's near kinswoman.   --Lev. xviii.
                                                  12.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Close to one's interests, affection, etc.; touching, or
      affecting intimately; intimate; dear; as, a near friend.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. Close to anything followed or imitated; not free, loose,

   5. So as barely to avoid or pass injury or loss; close;
      narrow[3]; as, a near escape; a near miss.

      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Near may properly be followed by to before the thing
         approached; but more frequently to is omitted, and the
         adjective or the adverb is regarded as a preposition.
         The same is also true of the word nigh.
         [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Nigh; close; adjacent; proximate; contiguous; present;
        ready; intimate; familiar; dear.
        [1913 Webster]
