   Introduction Nicaragua
   ----------------------
                            Background: Settled as a colony of Spain in the
                                        1520s, Nicaragua gained its
                                        independence in 1821. Violent
                                        opposition to governmental
                                        manipulation and corruption spread
                                        to all classes by 1978 and resulted
                                        in a short-lived civil war that
                                        brought the Marxist Sandinista
                                        guerrillas to power in 1979.
                                        Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in
                                        El Salvador caused the US to sponsor
                                        anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas
                                        through much of the 1980s. Free
                                        elections in 1990, 1996, and again
                                        in 2001 saw the Sandinistas
                                        defeated. The country has slowly
                                        rebuilt its economy during the
                                        1990s, but was hard hit by Hurricane
                                        Mitch in 1998.

   Economy Nicaragua
   -----------------
                    Economy - overview: Nicaragua, one of the hemisphere's
                                        poorest countries, faces low per
                                        capita income, flagging socio-
                                        economic indicators, and huge
                                        external debt. Distribution of
                                        income is extremely unequal. While
                                        the country has made progress toward
                                        macroeconomic stabilization over the
                                        past few years, a banking crisis and
                                        scandal has shaken the economy.
                                        Managua will continue to be
                                        dependent on international aid and
                                        debt relief under the Heavily
                                        Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
                                        initiative. Donors have made aid
                                        conditional on improving
                                        governability, the openness of
                                        government financial operation,
                                        poverty alleviation, and human
                                        rights. Nicaragua met the conditions
                                        for additional debt service relief
                                        in December 2000. Growth should move
                                        up in 2002 because of increased
                                        private investment and recovery in
                                        the global economy.
