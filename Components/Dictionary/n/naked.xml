      <WordDefinition>Naked
   This word denotes (1) absolute nakedness (Gen. 2:25; Job 1:21;
   Eccl. 5:15; Micah 1:8; Amos 2:16); (2) being poorly clad (Isa.
   58:7; James 2:15). It denotes also (3) the state of one who has
   laid aside his loose outer garment (Lat. nudus), and appears
   clothed only in a long tunic or under robe worn next the skin (1
   Sam. 19:24; Isa. 47:3; comp. Mark 14:52; John 21:7). It is used
   figuratively, meaning "being discovered" or "made manifest" (Job
   26:6; Heb. 4:13). In Ex. 32:25 the expression "the people were
   naked" (A.V.) is more correctly rendered in the Revised Version
   "the people were broken loose", i.e., had fallen into a state of
   lawlessness and insubordination. In 2 Chr. 28:19 the words "he
   made Judah naked" (A.V.), but Revised Version "he had dealt
   wantonly in Judah," mean "he had permitted Judah to break loose
   from all the restraints of religion."
