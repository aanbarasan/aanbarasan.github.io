   Introduction Netherlands
   ------------------------
                            Background: The Kingdom of the Netherlands was
                                        formed in 1815. In 1830 Belgium
                                        seceded and formed a separate
                                        kingdom. The Netherlands remained
                                        neutral in World War I but suffered
                                        a brutal invasion and occupation by
                                        Germany in World War II. A modern,
                                        industrialized nation, the
                                        Netherlands is also a large exporter
                                        of agricultural products. The
                                        country was a founding member of
                                        NATO and the EC, and participated in
                                        the introduction of the Economic and
                                        Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999.

   Economy Netherlands
   -------------------
                    Economy - overview: The Netherlands is a prosperous and
                                        open economy depending heavily on
                                        foreign trade. The economy is noted
                                        for stable industrial relations,
                                        moderate inflation, a sizable
                                        current account surplus, and an
                                        important role as a European
                                        transportation hub. Industrial
                                        activity is predominantly in food
                                        processing, chemicals, petroleum
                                        refining, and electrical machinery.
                                        A highly mechanized agricultural
                                        sector employs no more than 4% of
                                        the labor force but provides large
                                        surpluses for the food-processing
                                        industry and for exports. The
                                        Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU
                                        partners, began circulating the euro
                                        currency on 1 January 2002. The
                                        country continues to be one of the
                                        leading European nations for
                                        attracting foreign direct
                                        investment. Economic growth slowed
                                        considerably in 2001, as part of the
                                        global economic slowdown, but for
                                        the four years before that, annual
                                        growth averaged nearly 4%, well
                                        above the EU average.
