        (Scientific computation) Output from a computation that may
        not be significant but at least indicates that the program is
        running.  Numbers may be used to placate management, grant
        sponsors, etc.  "Making numbers" means running a program
        because output - any output, not necessarily meaningful output
        - is needed as a demonstration of progress.
     
        See {pretty pictures}, {math-out}, {social science number}.
