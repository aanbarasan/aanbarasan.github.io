      [1913 Webster]

            Evil news rides post, while good news baits.
                                                  --Milton.

      [1913 Webster]

      <WordDefinition>NeWS /nee'wis/, /n[y]oo'is/ or /n[y]ooz/ n. [acronym; the `Network
   Window System'] The road not taken in window systems, an elegant
   {{PostScript}}-based environment that would almost certainly have won
   the standards war with {X} if it hadn't been {proprietary} to Sun
   Microsystems. There is a lesson here that too many software vendors
   haven't yet heeded. Many hackers insist on the two-syllable
   pronunciations above as a way of distinguishing NeWS from Usenet news
   (the {netnews} software).
