   Syn: Vicinity; vicinage; proximity.

   Usage: {Neighborhood}, {Vicinity}. Neighborhood is

          houses immediately adjoining a square are in the
          neighborhood of that square; those which are somewhat
          further removed are also in the vicinity of the
          square.
          [1913 Webster]
