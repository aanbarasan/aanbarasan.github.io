      <WordDefinition>NOR
     
        Not OR.
     
        The {Boolean} function which is true if none of its inputs are
        true and false otherwise, the {logical complement} of
        {inclusive OR}.  The binary (two-input) NOR function can be
        defined (written as an {infix} operator):
     
        A NOR B = NOT (A OR B) = (NOT A) AND (NOT B)
     
        Its {truth table} is:
     
        	A | B | A NOR B
        	--+---+---------
        	F | F |    T
        	F | T |	   F
        	T | F |    F
        	T | T |    F
     
        NOR, like {NAND}, forms a complete set of {Boolean} functions on
        its own since it can be used to make NOT, AND, OR and any
        other Boolean function:
     
        NOT A = A NOR A
     
        A OR B = NOT (A NOR B)
     
        A AND B = (NOT A) NOR (NOT B)

      <WordDefinition>Nor \Nor\ (n[^o]r), conj. [OE. nor, contr. from nother. See
   {Neither}.]
   A negative connective or particle, introducing the second
   member or clause of a negative proposition, following
   neither, or not, in the first member or clause (as or in
   affirmative propositions follows either). Nor is also used
   sometimes in the first member for neither, and sometimes the
   neither is omitted and implied by the use of nor.
