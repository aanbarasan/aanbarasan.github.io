      <WordDefinition>Onion
   The Israelites in the wilderness longed for the "onions and
   garlick of Egypt" (Num. 11:5). This was the _betsel_ of the
   Hebrews, the Allium cepe of botanists, of which it is said that
   there are some thirty or forty species now growing in Palestine.
   The onion is "the 'undivided' leek, _unio_, _unus_, one."
