      <WordDefinition>OUTCOME, n.  A particular type of disappointment.  By the kind of
intelligence that sees in an exception a proof of the rule the wisdom
of an act is judged by the outcome, the result.  This is immortal
nonsense; the wisdom of an act is to be juded by the light that the
doer had when he performed it.

   --H. Spenser.

         All true literature, all genuine poetry, is the direct
         outcome, the condensed essence, of actual life and
         thought.                                 --J. C.
                                                  Shairp.
