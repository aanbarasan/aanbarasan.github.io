   Note: From is the primary sense of this preposition; a sense
         retained in off, the same word differently written for
         distinction. But this radical sense disappears in most
         of its application; as, a man of genius; a man of rare
         endowments; a fossil of a red color, or of an hexagonal
         figure; he lost all hope of relief; an affair of the
         cabinet; he is a man of decayed fortune; what is the
         price of corn? In these and similar phrases, of denotes
         property or possession, or a relation of some sort
         involving connection. These applications, however all
         proceeded from the same primary sense. That which
         proceeds from, or is produced by, a person or thing,
         either has had, or still has, a close connection with
         the same; and hence the word was applied to cases of
         mere connection, not involving at all the idea of
         separation.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Of consequence}, of importance, value, or influence.

   {Of late}, recently; in time not long past.

   {Of old}, formerly; in time long past.

   {Of one's self}, by one's self; without help or prompting;
      spontaneously.
      [1913 Webster]

            Why, knows not Montague, that of itself
            England is safe, if true within itself? --Shak.
