      <WordDefinition>Or \Or\ ([^o]r), conj. [OE. or, outher, other, auther, either,
   or, AS. [=a]w[eth]er, contr. from [=a]hw[ae][eth]er; [=a] aye
   + hw[ae][eth]er whether. See {Aye}, and {Whether}, and cf.
   {Either}.]
   A particle that marks an alternative; as, you may read or may
   write, -- that is, you may do one of the things at your
   pleasure, but not both. It corresponds to {either}. You may
   ride either to London or to Windsor. It often connects a
   series of words or propositions, presenting a choice of
   either; as, he may study law, or medicine, or divinity, or he
   may enter into trade.
   [1913 Webster]

         If man's convenience, health,
         Or safety interfere, his rights and claims
         Are paramount.                           --Cowper.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Or may be used to join as alternatives terms expressing
         unlike things or ideas (as, is the orange sour or
         sweet?), or different terms expressing the same thing
         or idea; as, this is a sphere, or globe.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: Or sometimes begins a sentence. In this case it
         expresses an alternative or subjoins a clause differing
         from the foregoing. ``Or what man is there of you, who,
         if his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a
         stone?'' --Matt. vii. 9 (Rev. Ver.).
         [1913 Webster] Or for either is archaic or poetic.
         [1913 Webster]

               Maugre thine heed, thou must for indigence
               Or steal, or beg, or borrow thy dispence.
                                                  --Chaucer.
