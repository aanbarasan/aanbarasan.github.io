      <WordDefinition>Oven
   Heb. tannur, (Hos. 7:4). In towns there appear to have been
   public ovens. There was a street in Jerusalem (Jer. 37:21)
   called "bakers' street" (the only case in which the name of a
   street in Jerusalem is preserved). The words "tower of the
   furnaces" (Neh. 3:11; 12:38) is more properly "tower of the
   ovens" (Heb. tannurim). These resemble the ovens in use among
   ourselves.
   
     There were other private ovens of different kinds. Some were
   like large jars made of earthenware or copper, which were heated
   inside with wood (1 Kings 17:12; Isa. 44:15; Jer. 7:18) or grass
   (Matt. 6:30), and when the fire had burned out, small pieces of
   dough were placed inside or spread in thin layers on the
   outside, and were thus baked. (See {FURNACE}.)
   
     Pits were also formed for the same purposes, and lined with
   cement. These were used after the same manner.
   
     Heated stones, or sand heated by a fire heaped over it, and
   also flat irons pans, all served as ovens for the preparation of
   bread. (See Gen. 18:6; 1 Kings 19:6.)
