      <WordDefinition>Olive
   the fruit of the olive-tree. This tree yielded oil which was
   highly valued. The best oil was from olives that were plucked
   before being fully ripe, and then beaten or squeezed (Deut.
   24:20; Isa. 17:6; 24:13). It was called "beaten," or "fresh oil"
   (Ex. 27:20). There were also oil-presses, in which the oil was
   trodden out by the feet (Micah 6:15). James (3:12) calls the
   fruit "olive berries." The phrase "vineyards and olives" (Judg.
   15:5, A.V.) should be simply "olive-yard," or "olive-garden," as
   in the Revised Version. (See {OIL}.)
