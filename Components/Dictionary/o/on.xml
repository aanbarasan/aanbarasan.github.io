      <WordDefinition>On
   light; the sun, (Gen. 41:45, 50), the great seat of sun-worship,
   called also Bethshemesh (Jer. 43:13) and Aven (Ezek. 30:17),
   stood on the east bank of the Nile, a few miles north of
   Memphis, and near Cairo, in the north-east. The Vulgate and the
   LXX. Versions have "Heliopolis" ("city of the sun") instead of
   On in Genesis and of Aven in Ezekiel. The "city of destruction"
   Isaiah speaks of (19:18, marg. "of Heres;" Heb. 'Ir-ha-heres,
   which some MSS. read Ir-ha-heres, i.e., "city of the sun") may
   be the name given to On, the prophecy being that the time will
   come when that city which was known as the "city of the sun-god"
   shall become the "city of destruction" of the sun-god, i.e.,
   when idolatry shall cease, and the worship of the true God be
   established.
   
     In ancient times this city was full of obelisks dedicated to
   the sun. Of these only one now remains standing. "Cleopatra's
   Needle" was one of those which stood in this city in front of
   the Temple of Tum, i.e., "the sun." It is now erected on the
   Thames Embankment, London.
   
     "It was at On that Joseph wooed and won the dark-skinned
   Asenath, the daughter of the high priest of its great temple."
   This was a noted university town, and here Moses gained his
   acquaintance with "all the wisdom of the Egyptians."
