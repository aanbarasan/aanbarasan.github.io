      <WordDefinition>Oracle
   In the Old Testament used in every case, except 2 Sam. 16:23, to
   denote the most holy place in the temple (1 Kings 6:5, 19-23;
   8:6). In 2 Sam. 16:23 it means the Word of God. A man inquired
   "at the oracle of God" by means of the Urim and Thummim in the
   breastplate on the high priest's ephod. In the New Testament it
   is used only in the plural, and always denotes the Word of God
   (Rom. 3:2; Heb. 5:12, etc.). The Scriptures are called "living
   oracles" (comp. Heb. 4:12) because of their quickening power
   (Acts 7:38).
