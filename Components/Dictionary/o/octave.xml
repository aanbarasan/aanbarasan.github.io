      <WordDefinition>Octave
     
        &lt;language&gt; A high-level {interactive} language by John
        W. Eaton, with help from many others, like {MATLAB}, primarily
        intended for numerical computations.  Octave provides a
        convenient {command line interface} for solving linear and
        nonlinear problems numerically.
     
        Octave can do arithmetic for {real} and {complex} {scalars}
        and {matrices}, solve sets of nonlinear algebraic equations,
        integrate functions over finite and infinite intervals, and
        integrate systems of ordinary differential and
        differential-algebraic equations.
     
        Octave has been compiled and tested with {g++} and libg++ on a
        {SPARCstation 2} running {SunOS} 4.1.2, an {IBM} {RS/6000}
        running {AIX} 3.2.5, {DEC Alpha} systems running {OSF}/1 1.3
        and 3.0, a {DECstation 5000}/240 running {Ultrix} 4.2a, and
        {Intel 486} systems running {Linux}.  It should work on most
        other {Unix} systems with {g++} and libg++.
     
        Octave is distributed under the {GNU} {General Public
        License}.  It requires {gnuplot}, a {C++} compiler and
        {Fortran} compiler or {f2c} translator.
     
        Latest version: 2.0.16 (released 2000-01-30), as of 2000-06-26.
