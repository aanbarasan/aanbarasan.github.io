      <WordDefinition>Oil
   Only olive oil seems to have been used among the Hebrews. It was
   used for many purposes: for anointing the body or the hair (Ex.
   29:7; 2 Sam. 14:2; Ps. 23:5; 92:10; 104:15; Luke 7:46); in some
   of the offerings (Ex. 29:40; Lev. 7:12; Num. 6:15; 15:4), but
   was excluded from the sin-offering (Lev. 5:11) and the
   jealousy-offering (Num. 5:15); for burning in lamps (Ex. 25:6;
   27:20; Matt. 25:3); for medicinal purposes (Isa. 1:6; Luke
   10:34; James 5:14); and for anointing the dead (Matt. 26:12;
   Luke 23:56).
   
     It was one of the most valuable products of the country (Deut.
   32:13; Ezek. 16:13), and formed an article of extensive commerce
   with Tyre (27:17).
   
     The use of it was a sign of gladness (Ps. 92:10; Isa. 61:3),
   and its omission a token of sorrow (2 Sam. 14:2; Matt. 6:17). It
   was very abundant in Galilee. (See {OLIVE}.)

      <WordDefinition>Oil \Oil\ (oil), n. [OE. oile, OF. oile, F. huile, fr. L. oleum;
   akin to Gr. ?. Cf. {Olive}.]
   Any one of a great variety of unctuous combustible
   substances, more viscous than and not miscible with water;
   as, olive oil, whale oil, rock oil, etc. They are of animal,
   vegetable, or mineral origin and of varied composition, and
   they are variously used for food, for solvents, for
   anointing, lubrication, illumination, etc. By extension, any
   substance of an oily consistency; as, oil of vitriol.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The mineral oils are varieties of petroleum. See
         {Petroleum}. The vegetable oils are of two classes,
         {essential oils} (see under {Essential}), and {natural
         oils} which in general resemble the animal oils and
         fats. Most of the natural oils and the animal oils and
         fats consist of ethereal salts of glycerin, with a
         large number of organic acids, principally stearic,
         oleic, and palmitic, forming respectively stearin,
         olein, and palmitin. Stearin and palmitin prevail in
         the solid oils and fats, and olein in the liquid oils.
         Mutton tallow, beef tallow, and lard are rich in
         stearin, human fat and palm oil in palmitin, and sperm
         and cod-liver oils in olein. In making soaps, the acids
         leave the glycerin and unite with the soda or potash.
         [1913 Webster]
