      <WordDefinition>Orion
   Heb. Kesil; i.e., "the fool", the name of a constellation (Job
   9:9; 38:31; Amos 5:8) consisting of about eighty stars. The
   Vulgate renders thus, but the LXX. renders by Hesperus, i.e.,
   "the evening-star," Venus. The Orientals "appear to have
   conceived of this constellation under the figure of an impious
   giant bound upon the sky." This giant was, according to
   tradition, Nimrod, the type of the folly that contends against
   God. In Isa. 13:10 the plural form of the Hebrew word is
   rendered "constellations."
