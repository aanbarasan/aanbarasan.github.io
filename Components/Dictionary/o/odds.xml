      <WordDefinition>Odds \Odds\ ([o^]dz), n. sing. &amp; pl. [See {Odd}, a.]
   1. Difference in favor of one and against another; excess of
      one of two things or numbers over the other; inequality;
      advantage; superiority; hence, excess of chances;
      probability. The odds are often expressed by a ratio; as,
      the odds are three to one that he will win, i. e. he will
      win three times out of four ``Pre["e]minent by so much
      odds.'' --Milton. ``The fearful odds of that unequal
      fray.'' --Trench.
      [1913 Webster]

            The odds
            Is that we scarce are men and you are gods. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            There appeared, at least, four to one odds against
            them.                                 --Swift.
      [1913 Webster]

            All the odds between them has been the different
            scope . . . given to their understandings to range
            in.                                   --Locke.
      [1913 Webster]

            Judging is balancing an account and determining on
            which side the odds lie.              --Locke.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Quarrel; dispute; debate; strife; -- chiefly in the phrase
      at odds.
      [1913 Webster]

            Set them into confounding odds.       --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            I can not speak
            Any beginning to this peevish odds.   --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   {At odds}, in dispute; at variance. ``These squires at odds
      did fall.'' --Spenser. ``He flashes into one gross crime
      or other, that sets us all at odds.'' --Shak.

   {It is odds}, it is probable; same as {odds are}, but no
      longer used. [Obs.] --Jer. Taylor.

   {odds are} it is probable; as, odds are he will win the gold
      medal.

   {Odds and ends}, that which is left; remnants; fragments;
      refuse; scraps; miscellaneous articles. ``My brain is
      filled . . . with all kinds of odds and ends.'' --W.
      Irving.

   {slim odds} low odds; poor chances; as, there are slim odds
      he will win any medal.
      [1913 Webster +PJC]
