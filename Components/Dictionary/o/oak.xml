      <WordDefinition>Oak
   There are six Hebrew words rendered "oak."
   
     (1.) 'El occurs only in the word El-paran (Gen. 14:6). The
   LXX. renders by "terebinth." In the plural form this word occurs
   in Isa. 1:29; 57:5 (A.V. marg. and R.V., "among the oaks"); 61:3
   ("trees"). The word properly means strongly, mighty, and hence a
   strong tree.
   
     (2.) 'Elah, Gen. 35:4, "under the oak which was by Shechem"
   (R.V. marg., "terebinth"). Isa. 6:13, A.V., "teil-tree;" R.V.,
   "terebinth." Isa. 1:30, R.V. marg., "terebinth." Absalom in his
   flight was caught in the branches of a "great oak" (2 Sam. 18:9;
   R.V. marg., "terebinth").
   
     (3.) 'Elon, Judg. 4:11; 9:6 (R.V., "oak;" A.V., following the
   Targum, "plain") properly the deciduous species of oak shedding
   its foliage in autumn.
   
     (4.) 'Elan, only in Dan. 4:11,14,20, rendered "tree" in
   Nebuchadnezzar's dream. Probably some species of the oak is
   intended.
   
     (5.) 'Allah, Josh. 24:26. The place here referred to is called
   Allon-moreh ("the oak of Moreh," as in R.V.) in Gen. 12:6 and
   35:4.
   
     (6.) 'Allon, always rendered "oak." Probably the evergreen oak
   (called also ilex and holm oak) is intended. The oak woods of
   Bashan are frequently alluded to (Isa. 2:13; Ezek. 27:6). Three
   species of oaks are found in Palestine, of which the "prickly
   evergreen oak" (Quercus coccifera) is the most abundant. "It
   covers the rocky hills of Palestine with a dense brushwood of
   trees from 8 to 12 feet high, branching from the base, thickly
   covered with small evergreen rigid leaves, and bearing acorns
   copiously." The so-called Abraham's oak at Hebron is of this
   species. Tristram says that this oak near Hebron "has for
   several centuries taken the place of the once renowned terebinth
   which marked the site of Mamre on the other side of the city.
   The terebinth existed at Mamre in the time of Vespasian, and
   under it the captive Jews were sold as slaves. It disappeared
   about A.D. 330, and no tree now marks the grove of Mamre. The
   present oak is the noblest tree in Southern Palestine, being 23
   feet in girth, and the diameter of the foliage, which is
   unsymmetrical, being about 90 feet." (See {HEBRON};
   TEIL-{TREE}.)

      <WordDefinition>Oak \Oak\ ([=o]k), n. [OE. oke, ok, ak, AS. [=a]c; akin to D.
   eik, G. eiche, OHG. eih, Icel. eik, Sw. ek, Dan. eeg.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. (Bot.) Any tree or shrub of the genus {Quercus}. The oaks
      have alternate leaves, often variously lobed, and
      staminate flowers in catkins. The fruit is a smooth nut,
      called an {acorn}, which is more or less inclosed in a
      scaly involucre called the cup or cupule. There are now
      recognized about three hundred species, of which nearly
      fifty occur in the United States, the rest in Europe,
      Asia, and the other parts of North America, a very few
      barely reaching the northern parts of South America and
      Africa. Many of the oaks form forest trees of grand
      proportions and live many centuries. The wood is usually
      hard and tough, and provided with conspicuous medullary
      rays, forming the silver grain.
      [1913 Webster]
