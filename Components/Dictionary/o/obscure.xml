      <WordDefinition>obscure adj. Used in an exaggeration of its normal meaning, to imply
   total incomprehensibility. "The reason for that last crash is obscure."
   "The `find(1)' command's syntax is obscure!" The phrase `moderately
   obscure' implies that something could be figured out but probably isn't
   worth the trouble. The construction `obscure in the extreme' is the
   preferred emphatic form.
