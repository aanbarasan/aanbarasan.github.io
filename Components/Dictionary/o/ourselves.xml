      <WordDefinition>Ourselves \Our*selves"\, pron.; sing. {Ourself} (?).
   An emphasized form of the pronoun of the first person plural;
   -- used as a subject, usually with we; also, alone in the
   predicate, in the nominative or the objective case.
   [1913 Webster]

         We ourselves might distinctly number in words a great
         deal further then we usually do.         --Locke.
   [1913 Webster]

         Safe in ourselves, while on ourselves we stand.
                                                  --Dryden.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The form ourself is used only in the regal or formal
         style after we or us, denoting a single person.
         [1913 Webster]

               Unless we would denude ourself of all force.
                                                  --Clarendon.
         [1913 Webster]

   I or me in person; -- used for emphasis, my own self or
