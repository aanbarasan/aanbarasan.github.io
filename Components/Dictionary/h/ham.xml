      <WordDefinition>Ham
   warm, hot, and hence the south; also an Egyptian word meaning
   "black", the youngest son of Noah (Gen. 5:32; comp. 9:22,24).
   The curse pronounced by Noah against Ham, properly against
   Canaan his fourth son, was accomplished when the Jews
   subsequently exterminated the Canaanites.
   
     One of the most important facts recorded in Gen. 10 is the
   foundation of the earliest monarchy in Babylonia by Nimrod the
   grandson of Ham (6, 8, 10). The primitive Babylonian empire was
   thus Hamitic, and of a cognate race with the primitive
   inhabitants of Arabia and of Ethiopia. (See {ACCAD}.)
   
     The race of Ham were the most energetic of all the descendants
   of Noah in the early times of the post-diluvian world.
