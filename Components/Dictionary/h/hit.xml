      <WordDefinition>hit
     
        1. &lt;architecture&gt; {cache hit}.
     
        2. &lt;World-Wide Web&gt; A request to a {web server} from a {web
        browser} or other {client} (e.g. a {robot}).
     
        The number of hits on a server may be important for
        determining advertising revenue.
     
        In the course of loading a single {web page}, a browser may
        hit a web server many times e.g. to retrieve the page itself
        and each {image} on the page.  In contrast, caching by
        browsers and {web proxies} reduces the number of hits on the
        server because some requests are satisfied from the cache.
     
        3. &lt;jargon&gt; To press and release a key on the keyboard.  Some
        prefer the less aggressive "tap".
