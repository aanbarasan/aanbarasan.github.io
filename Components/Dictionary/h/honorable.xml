         lords of session, and the supreme judges of England and
         Ireland are entitled to the prefix. In American usage,
         it is a title of courtesy merely, bestowed upon those
         who hold, or have held, any of the higher public
         offices, esp. governors, judges, members of Congress or
         of the Senate, mayors, and often also extended to lower
         officials, such as city council members.
