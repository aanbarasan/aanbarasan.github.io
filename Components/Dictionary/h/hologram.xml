      <WordDefinition>hologram \hol"o*gram\, n.
   A photographic image giving the observer a seemingly
   three-dimensional view of the represented object. The
   three-dimensional effect is produced by exposing a
   photographic recording medium to an interference pattern
   generated by a coherent beam of light (as from a laser)
   reflected from the subject, interacting with a beam directly
   from the source. The full three-dimensional effect requires
   illumination of the image with coherent light, but less
   perfect three-dimensional visual effects may also be observed
   when the hologram is illuminated with white light.
