   Syn: To aid; assist; succor; relieve; serve; support;
        sustain; befriend.

   Usage: To {Help}, {Aid}, {Assist}. These words all agree in
          the idea of affording relief or support to a person
          under difficulties. Help turns attention especially to
          the source of relief. If I fall into a pit, I call for
          help; and he who helps me out does it by an act of his
          own. Aid turns attention to the other side, and
          supposes co["o]peration on the part of him who is
          relieved; as, he aided me in getting out of the pit; I
          got out by the aid of a ladder which he brought.
          Assist has a primary reference to relief afforded by a
          person who ``stands by'' in order to relieve. It
          denotes both help and aid. Thus, we say of a person
          who is weak, I assisted him upstairs, or, he mounted
          the stairs by my assistance. When help is used as a
          noun, it points less distinctively and exclusively to
          the source of relief, or, in other words, agrees more
          closely with aid. Thus we say, I got out of a pit by
          the help of my friend.
