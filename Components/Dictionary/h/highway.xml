      <WordDefinition>Highway
   a raised road for public use. Such roads were not found in
   Palestine; hence the force of the language used to describe the
   return of the captives and the advent of the Messiah (Isa.
   11:16; 35:8; 40:3; 62:10) under the figure of the preparation of
   a grand thoroughfare for their march.
   
     During their possession of Palestine the Romans constructed
   several important highways, as they did in all countries which
   they ruled.
