      <WordDefinition>henry
     
        &lt;unit&gt; (H) The {SI} unit of inductance: one henry is the
        inductance of a closed loop in which the induced voltage is
        one volt if the current flowing through it changes by one
        ampere each second, i.e., 1 H = 1 Vs/A.  Named after the
        American physicist Joseph Henry (1797-1878).

   American physicist.]
   The unit of electric induction; the induction in a circuit
   when the electro-motive force induced in this circuit is one
   volt, while the inducing current varies at the rate of one
   amp[`e]re a second.
