      <WordDefinition>Hunger \Hun"ger\, n. [AS. hungor; akin to OFries. hunger, D.

      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The sensation of hunger is usually referred to the
         stomach, but is probably dependent on excitation of the
         sensory nerves, both of the stomach and intestines, and
         perhaps also on indirect impressions from other organs,
         more or less exhausted from lack of nutriment.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. Any strong eager desire.
      [1913 Webster]

            O sacred hunger of ambitious minds!   --Spenser.
