      <WordDefinition>hairy
     
        1. Annoyingly complicated.  "{DWIM} is incredibly hairy."
     
        2. Incomprehensible.  "{DWIM} is incredibly hairy."
     
        3. Of people, high-powered, authoritative, rare, expert,
        and/or incomprehensible.  Hard to explain except in context:
        "He knows this hairy lawyer who says there's nothing to worry
        about."  See also {hirsute}.
     
        The adjective "long-haired" is well-attested to have been in
        slang use among scientists and engineers during the early
        1950s; it was equivalent to modern "hairy" and was very likely
        ancestral to the hackish use.  In fact the noun "long-hair"
        was at the time used to describe a hairy person.  Both senses
        probably passed out of use when long hair was adopted as a
        signature trait by the 1960s counterculture, leaving hackish
        "hairy" as a sort of stunted mutant relic.

      <WordDefinition>hairy adj. 1. Annoyingly complicated. "{DWIM} is incredibly hairy." 2.
   Incomprehensible. "{DWIM} is incredibly hairy." 3. Of people,
   high-powered, authoritative, rare, expert, and/or incomprehensible. Hard
   to explain except in context: "He knows this hairy lawyer who says
   there's nothing to worry about." See also {hirsute}.

   There is a theorem in simplicial homology theory which states that any
   continuous tangent field on a 2-sphere is null at least in a point.
   Mathematically literate hackers tend to associate the term `hairy' with
   the informal version of this theorem; "You can't comb a hairy ball
   smooth." (Previous versions of this entry associating the above informal
   statement with the Brouwer fixed-point theorem were incorrect.)

   The adjective `long-haired' is well-attested to have been in slang use
   among scientists and engineers during the early 1950s; it was equivalent
   to modern `hairy' senses 1 and 2, and was very likely ancestral to the
   hackish use. In fact the noun `long-hair' was at the time used to
   describe a person satisfying sense 3. Both senses probably passed out of
   use when long hair was adopted as a signature trait by the 1960s
   counterculture, leaving hackish `hairy' as a sort of stunted mutant
   relic.

   In British mainstream use, "hairy" means "dangerous", and
   consequently, in British programming terms, "hairy" may be used to
   denote complicated and/or incomprehensible code, but only if that
   complexity or incomprehesiveness is also considered dangerous.
