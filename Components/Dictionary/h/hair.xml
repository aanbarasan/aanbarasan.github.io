      <WordDefinition>Hair
   (1.) The Egyptians let the hair of their head and beard grow
   only when they were in mourning, shaving it off at other times.
   "So particular were they on this point that to have neglected it
   was a subject of reproach and ridicule; and whenever they
   intended to convey the idea of a man of low condition, or a
   slovenly person, the artists represented him with a beard."
   Joseph shaved himself before going in to Pharoah (Gen. 41:14).
   The women of Egypt wore their hair long and plaited. Wigs were
   worn by priests and laymen to cover the shaven skull, and false
   beards were common. The great masses of hair seen in the
   portraits and statues of kings and priests are thus altogether
   artificial.
   
     (2.) A precisely opposite practice, as regards men, prevailed
   among the Assyrians. In Assyrian sculptures the hair always
   appears long, and combed closely down upon the head. The beard
   also was allowed to grow to its full length.
   
     (3.) Among the Greeks the custom in this respect varied at
   different times, as it did also among the Romans. In the time of
   the apostle, among the Greeks the men wore short hair, while
   that of the women was long (1 Cor. 11:14, 15). Paul reproves the
   Corinthians for falling in with a style of manners which so far
   confounded the distinction of the sexes and was hurtful to good
   morals. (See, however, 1 Tim. 2:9, and 1 Pet. 3:3, as regards
   women.)
   
     (4.) Among the Hebrews the natural distinction between the
   sexes was preserved by the women wearing long hair (Luke 7:38;
   John 11:2; 1 Cor. 11:6), while the men preserved theirs as a
   rule at a moderate length by frequent clipping.
   
     Baldness disqualified any one for the priest's office (Lev.
   21).
   
     Elijah is called a "hairy man" (2 Kings 1:8) from his flowing
   locks, or more probably from the shaggy cloak of hair which he
   wore. His raiment was of camel's hair.
   
     Long hair is especially noticed in the description of
   Absalom's person (2 Sam. 14:26); but the wearing of long hair
   was unusual, and was only practised as an act of religious
   observance by Nazarites (Num. 6:5; Judg. 13:5) and others in
   token of special mercies (Acts 18:18).
   
     In times of affliction the hair was cut off (Isa. 3:17, 24;
   15:2; 22:12; Jer. 7:29; Amos 8:10). Tearing the hair and letting
   it go dishevelled were also tokens of grief (Ezra 9:3). "Cutting
   off the hair" is a figure of the entire destruction of a people
   (Isa. 7:20). The Hebrews anointed the hair profusely with
   fragrant ointments (Ruth 3:3; 2 Sam. 14:2; Ps. 23:5; 45:7,
   etc.), especially in seasons of rejoicing (Matt. 6:17; Luke
   7:46).
