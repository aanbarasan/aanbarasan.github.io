                                                  16.
      [1913 Webster]

            Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; him shalt thou
            serve.                                --Deut. x. 20.

   3. Man; a male; any male person; -- in this sense used

      [1913 Webster]

   Note: When a collective noun or a class is referred to, he is
         of common gender. In early English, he referred to a
         feminine or neuter noun, or to one in the plural, as
         well as to noun in the masculine singular. In
         composition, he denotes a male animal; as, a he-goat.
         [1913 Webster]

      <WordDefinition>His \His\ (h[i^]z), pron. [AS. his of him, his, gen. masc. &amp;
   neut. of h[=e], neut. hit. See {He}.]
   1. Belonging or pertaining to him; -- used as a pronominal
      adjective or adjective pronoun; as, tell John his papers
      are ready; formerly used also for its, but this use is now
      obsolete.
      [1913 Webster]

            No comfortable star did lend his light. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
            Unfix his earth-bound root?           --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Also formerly used in connection with a noun simply as
         a sign of the possessive. ``The king his son.'' --Shak.
         ``By young Telemachus his blooming years.'' --Pope.
         This his is probably a corruption of the old possessive
         ending -is or -es, which, being written as a separate
         word, was at length confounded with the pronoun his.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. The possessive of he; as, the book is his. ``The sea is
      his, and he made it.'' --Ps. xcv. 5.
