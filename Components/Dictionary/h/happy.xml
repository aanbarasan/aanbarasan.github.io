      <WordDefinition>Happy
     
        &lt;tool&gt; A dyslexic acronym for "A Yacc-like Haskell Parser
        generator".
     
        An {LALR1 grammar} {parser generator} for {Haskell}.  Happy is
        written in Haskell, uses a parser generated by itself, and can
        be compiled using {ghc}, {hbc} or {gofer}.  Happy uses an
        implementation of {monadic IO} built on top of stream IO, but
        this should change when the {Haskell 1.3} {standard} has been
        implemented.
     
        Version: 0.9 (1996-02-28).
     
        Happy is covered by the {General Public License}.
