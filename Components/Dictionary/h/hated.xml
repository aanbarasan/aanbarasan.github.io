                                                  iii. 15.

   Syn: To {Hate}, {Abhor}, {Detest}, {Abominate}, {Loathe}.

   Usage: Hate is the generic word, and implies that one is
          inflamed with extreme dislike. We abhor what is deeply
          repugnant to our sensibilities or feelings. We detest
          what contradicts so utterly our principles and moral
          sentiments that we feel bound to lift up our voice
          against it. What we abominate does equal violence to
          our moral and religious sentiments. What we loathe is
          offensive to our own nature, and excites unmingled
          disgust. Our Savior is said to have hated the deeds of
          the Nicolaitanes; his language shows that he loathed
          the lukewarmness of the Laodiceans; he detested the
          hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees; he abhorred
          the suggestions of the tempter in the wilderness.
          [1913 Webster]
