      <WordDefinition>Hydrodynamics \Hy`dro*dy*nam"ics\, n. [Hydro-, 1 + dynamics: cf.
   F. hydrodynamique.]
   That branch of the science of mechanics which relates to
   fluids, or, as usually limited, which treats of the laws of
   motion and action of nonelastic fluids, whether as
   investigated mathematically, or by observation and
   experiment; the principles of dynamics, as applied to water
   and other fluids.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The word is sometimes used as a general term, including
         both hydrostatics and hydraulics, together with
         pneumatics and acoustics. See {Hydraulics}.

      <WordDefinition>Mechanics \Me*chan"ics\, n. [Cf. F. m['e]canique.]
   That science, or branch of applied mathematics, which treats
   of the action of forces on bodies.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: That part of mechanics which considers the action of
         forces in producing rest or equilibrium is called
         {statics}; that which relates to such action in
         producing motion is called {dynamics}. The term
         mechanics includes the action of forces on all bodies,
         whether solid, liquid, or gaseous. It is sometimes,
         however, and formerly was often, used distinctively of
         solid bodies only: The mechanics of liquid bodies is
         called also {hydrostatics}, or {hydrodynamics},
         according as the laws of rest or of motion are
         considered. The mechanics of gaseous bodies is called
         also {pneumatics}. The mechanics of fluids in motion,
         with special reference to the methods of obtaining from
         them useful results, constitutes {hydraulics}.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Animal mechanics} (Physiol.), that portion of physiology
      which has for its object the investigation of the laws of
      equilibrium and motion in the animal body. The most
      important mechanical principle is that of the lever, the
      bones forming the arms of the levers, the contractile
      muscles the power, the joints the fulcra or points of
      support, while the weight of the body or of the individual
      limbs constitutes the weight or resistance.

   {Applied mechanics}, the principles of abstract mechanics
      applied to human art; also, the practical application of
      the laws of matter and motion to the construction of
      machines and structures of all kinds.

   {orbital mechanics}, the principles governing the motion of
      bodies in orbit around other bodies under gravitational
      influence, such as artificial Earth satellites.
