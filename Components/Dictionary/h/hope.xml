      <WordDefinition>HOPE, n.  Desire and expectation rolled into one.

    Delicious Hope! when naught to man it left --
    Of fortune destitute, of friends bereft;
    When even his dog deserts him, and his goat
    With tranquil disaffection chews his coat
    While yet it hangs upon his back; then thou,
    The star far-flaming on thine angel brow,
    Descendest, radiant, from the skies to hint
    The promise of a clerkship in the Mint.
                                                       Fogarty Weffing

      <WordDefinition>Hope
   one of the three main elements of Christian character (1 Cor.
   13:13). It is joined to faith and love, and is opposed to seeing
   or possessing (Rom. 8:24; 1 John 3:2). "Hope is an essential and
   fundamental element of Christian life, so essential indeed,
   that, like faith and love, it can itself designate the essence
   of Christianity (1 Pet. 3:15; Heb. 10:23). In it the whole glory
   of the Christian vocation is centred (Eph. 1:18; 4:4)."
   Unbelievers are without this hope (Eph. 2:12; 1 Thess. 4:13).
   Christ is the actual object of the believer's hope, because it
   is in his second coming that the hope of glory will be fulfilled
   (1 Tim. 1:1; Col. 1:27; Titus 2:13). It is spoken of as
   "lively", i.e., a living, hope, a hope not frail and perishable,
   but having a perennial life (1 Pet. 1:3). In Rom. 5:2 the "hope"
   spoken of is probably objective, i.e., "the hope set before us,"
   namely, eternal life (comp. 12:12). In 1 John 3:3 the expression
   "hope in him" ought rather to be, as in the Revised Version,
   "hope on him," i.e., a hope based on God.

      <WordDefinition>Hope
     
        &lt;language&gt; A {functional programming} language designed by
        R.M. Burstall, D.B. MacQueen and D.T. Sanella at {University
        of Edinburgh} in 1978.  It is a large language supporting
        user-defined {prefix}, {infix} or {distfix} operators.  Hope
        has {polymorphic} typing and allows {overloading} of operators
        which requires explicit type declarations.  Hope has {lazy
        lists} and was the first language to use {call-by-pattern}.
     
        It has been ported to {Unix}, {Macintosh}, and {IBM PC}.
