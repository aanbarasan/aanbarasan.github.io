      <WordDefinition>handshaking
     
        1. Predetermined hardware or software activity designed to
        establish or maintain two machines or programs in
        synchronisation.  Handshaking often concerns the exchange of
        messages or {packet}s of data between two systems with limited
        {buffer}s.  A simple handshaking {protocol} might only involve
        the receiver sending a message meaning "I received your last
        message and I am ready for you to send me another one."  A
        more complex handshaking {protocol} might allow the sender to
        ask the receiver if he is ready to receive or for the receiver
        to reply with a negative acknowledgement meaning "I did not
        receive your last message correctly, please resend it" (e.g. if
        the data was corrupted en route).
     
        {Hardware handshaking} uses voltage levels or pulses on wires
        to carry the handshaking signals whereas {software
        handshaking} uses data units (e.g. {ASCII} characters) carried
        by some underlying communication medium.
     
        {Flow control} in bit-serial data transmission such as
        {EIA-232} may use either hardware or software handshaking.
     
        2. The method used by two {modem}s to establish contact with
        each other and to agreee on {baud rate}, {error correction}
        and {compression} {protocol}s.
     
        3. The exchange of predetermined signals between agents
        connected by a communications channel to assure each that it
        is connected to the other (and not to an imposter).  This may
        also include the use of passwords and codes by an operator.

      <WordDefinition>handshaking n. [very common] Hardware or software activity designed to
   start or keep two machines or programs in synchronization as they {do
   protocol}. Often applied to human activity; thus, a hacker might watch
   two people in conversation nodding their heads to indicate that they
   have heard each others' points and say "Oh, they're handshaking!". See
   also {protocol}.
