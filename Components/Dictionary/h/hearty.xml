      <WordDefinition>Hearty \Heart"y\ (h[aum]rt"[y^]), a. [Compar. {Heartier}

      cordial; bold; zealous; sincere; willing; also, energetic;

      hearty man; hearty timber.

   Syn: Sincere; real; unfeigned; undissembled; cordial;
        earnest; warm; zealous; ardent; eager; active; vigorous.

   Usage: {Hearty}, {Cordial}, {Sincere}. Hearty implies honesty
          and simplicity of feelings and manners; cordial refers

          are expressed; sincere implies that this expression
          corresponds to the real sentiments of the heart. A man
          should be hearty in his attachment to his friends,
          cordial in his reception of them to his house, and
          sincere in his offers to assist them.
