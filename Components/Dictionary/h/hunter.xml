      <WordDefinition>Watch \Watch\ (w[o^]ch), n. [OE. wacche, AS. w[ae]cce, fr.
   wacian to wake; akin to D. wacht, waak, G. wacht, wache.
   [root]134. See {Wake}, v. i. ]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. The act of watching; forbearance of sleep; vigil; wakeful,
      vigilant, or constantly observant attention; close
      observation; guard; preservative or preventive vigilance;
      formerly, a watching or guarding by night.

      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Watch was formerly distinguished from ward, the former
         signifying a watching or guarding by night, and the
         latter a watching, guarding, or protecting by day
         Hence, they were not unfrequently used together,
         especially in the phrase to keep watch and ward, to
         denote continuous and uninterrupted vigilance or
         protection, or both watching and guarding. This
         distinction is now rarely recognized, watch being used
         to signify a watching or guarding both by night and by
         day, and ward, which is now rarely used, having simply
         the meaning of guard, or protection, without reference
         to time.
         [1913 Webster]

               Still, when she slept, he kept both watch and
               ward.                              --Spenser.
         [1913 Webster]

               Ward, guard, or custodia, is chiefly applied to
               the daytime, in order to apprehend rioters, and
               robbers on the highway . . . Watch, is properly
               applicable to the night only, . . . and it begins
               when ward ends, and ends when that begins.
                                                  --Blackstone.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. One who watches, or those who watch; a watchman, or a body
      of watchmen; a sentry; a guard.
      [1913 Webster]

            Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch; go your way,
            make it as sure as ye can.            --Matt. xxvii.
                                                  65.

   4. The period of the night during which a person does duty as

      [1913 Webster]

            Might we but hear . . .
            Or whistle from the lodge, or village cock
            Count the night watches to his feathery dames.
                                                  --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. A small timepiece, or chronometer, to be carried about the
      person, the machinery of which is moved by a spring.

         a {chronometer watch}, etc. (see the Note under
