      <WordDefinition>Habitation
   God is the habitation of his people, who find rest and safety in
   him (Ps. 71:3; 91:9). Justice and judgment are the habitation of
   God's throne (Ps. 89:14, Heb. mekhon, "foundation"), because all
   his acts are founded on justice and judgment. (See Ps. 132:5,
   13; Eph. 2:22, of Canaan, Jerusalem, and the temple as God's
   habitation.) God inhabits eternity (Isa. 57:15), i.e., dwells
   not only among men, but in eternity, where time is unknown; and
   "the praises of Israel" (Ps. 22:3), i.e., he dwells among those
   praises and is continually surrounded by them.
