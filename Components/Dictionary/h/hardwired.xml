      <WordDefinition>hard-wired
     
        1. &lt;electronics&gt; An aspect of an electronic circuit which is
        determined by the wiring of the hardware, as opposed to being
        programmable in software or controlled by a switch.
     
        2. &lt;software, jargon&gt; In software, a synonym for {hard-coded}.
     
        3. By extension, anything that is not modifiable, especially
        in the sense of customisable to one's particular needs or
        tastes.

   1. (Computers) Contained within the circuitry of a computer
      or computer peripheral device, and not changeable by
      programming; -- of functions; as, error correction is
      hard-wired into the circuit of the disk drive, so it
      proceeds very rapidly.
      [PJC]

   2. Connected by a continuous electrical wire, rather than
      through a switch; as, the air-conditioner was hard-wired
      into the wall circuit, so moving it would require an
      electrician.
      [PJC]

   3. (Metaph.) Performed by an inborn pattern of neural
      circuits; instinctive; not learned; as, many bird songs
      are hard-wired, but some are learned.
      [PJC]

            People, as the cybernetic metaphor now has it, are
            ``hard wired'' to do good in order to enhance their
            own happiness. --Andrew Delbanco (New York Times
      Magazine, May 7, 2000; p. 46).
