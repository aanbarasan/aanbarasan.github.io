      <WordDefinition>Blood \Blood\ (bl[u^]d), n. [OE. blod, blood, AS. bl[=o]d; akin
   to D. bloed, OHG. bluot, G. blut, Goth. bl[=o][thorn], Icel.

   Note: The blood consists of a liquid, the plasma, containing
         minute particles, the blood corpuscles. In the
         invertebrate animals it is usually nearly colorless,
         and contains only one kind of corpuscles; but in all
         vertebrates, except Amphioxus, it contains some
         colorless corpuscles, with many more which are red and
         give the blood its uniformly red color. See
         {Corpuscle}, {Plasma}.
         [1913 Webster]
