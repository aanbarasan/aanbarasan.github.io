      <WordDefinition>Harness
   (1.) Heb. 'asar, "to bind;" hence the act of fastening animals
   to a cart (1 Sam. 6:7, 10; Jer. 46:4, etc.).
   
     (2.) An Old English word for "armour;" Heb. neshek (2 Chr.
   9:24).
   
     (3.) Heb. shiryan, a coat of mail (1 Kings 22:34; 2 Chr.
   18:33; rendered "breastplate" in Isa. 59:17).
   
     (4.) The children of Israel passed out of Egypt "harnessed"
   (Ex. 13:18), i.e., in an orderly manner, and as if to meet a
   foe. The word so rendered is probably a derivative from Hebrew
   _hamesh_ (i.e., "five"), and may denote that they went up in
   five divisions, viz., the van, centre, two wings, and
   rear-guard.
