      machinery of any kind. See {Accumulator}, 2.

      pressure of water.

   {Hydraulic jack}. See under {Jack}.

   {Hydraulic lime}, quicklime obtained from hydraulic
      limestone, and used for cementing under water, etc.

   {Hydraulic limestone}, a limestone which contains some clay,
      and which yields a quicklime that will set, or form a

   {Hydraulic main} (Gas Works), a horizontal pipe containing
      water at the bottom into which the ends of the pipes from
      the retorts dip, for passing the gas through water in
      order to remove ammonia.

   {Hydraulic ram}, a machine for raising water by means of the
      energy of the moving water of which a portion is to be
      raised. When the rush of water through the main pipe d
      shuts the valve at a, the momentum of the current thus
      suddenly checked forces part of it into the air chamber b,
      and up the pipe c, its return being prevented by a valve
      at the entrance to the air chamber, while the dropping of
      the valve a by its own weight allows another rush through
      the main pipe, and so on alternately.

   {Hydraulic valve}. (Mach.)
   (a) A valve for regulating the distribution of water in the
       cylinders of hydraulic elevators, cranes, etc.
   (b) (Gas Works) An inverted cup with a partition dipping into
       water, for opening or closing communication between two
       gas mains, the open ends of which protrude about the
       water.
