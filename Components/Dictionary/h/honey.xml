      <WordDefinition>Honey
   (1.) Heb. ya'ar, occurs only 1 Sam. 14:25, 27, 29; Cant. 5:1,
   where it denotes the honey of bees. Properly the word signifies
   a forest or copse, and refers to honey found in woods.
   
     (2.) Nopheth, honey that drops (Ps. 19:10; Prov. 5:3; Cant.
   4:11).
   
     (3.) Debash denotes bee-honey (Judg. 14:8); but also
   frequently a vegetable honey distilled from trees (Gen. 43:11;
   Ezek. 27:17). In these passages it may probably mean "dibs," or
   syrup of grapes, i.e., the juice of ripe grapes boiled down to
   one-third of its bulk.
   
     (4.) Tsuph, the cells of the honey-comb full of honey (Prov.
   16:24; Ps. 19:10).
   
     (5.) "Wild honey" (Matt. 3:4) may have been the vegetable
   honey distilled from trees, but rather was honey stored by bees
   in rocks or in trees (Deut. 32:13; Ps. 81:16; 1 Sam. 14:25-29).
   
     Canaan was a "land flowing with milk and honey" (Ex. 3:8).
   Milk and honey were among the chief dainties in the earlier
   ages, as they are now among the Bedawin; and butter and honey
   are also mentioned among articles of food (Isa. 7:15). The
   ancients used honey instead of sugar (Ps. 119:103; Prov. 24:13);
   but when taken in great quantities it caused nausea, a fact
   referred to in Prov. 25:16, 17 to inculcate moderation in
   pleasures. Honey and milk also are put for sweet discourse
   (Cant. 4:11).
