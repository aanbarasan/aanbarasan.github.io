      <WordDefinition>Harp
   (Heb. kinnor), the national instrument of the Hebrews. It was
   invented by Jubal (Gen. 4:21). Some think the word _kinnor_
   denotes the whole class of stringed instruments. It was used as
   an accompaniment to songs of cheerfulness as well as of praise
   to God (Gen. 31:27; 1 Sam. 16:23; 2 Chr. 20:28; Ps. 33:2;
   137:2).
   
     In Solomon's time harps were made of almug-trees (1 Kings
   10:11, 12). In 1 Chr. 15:21 mention is made of "harps on the
   Sheminith;" Revised Version, "harps set to the Sheminith;"
   better perhaps "harps of eight strings." The soothing effect of
   the music of the harp is referred to 1 Sam. 16:16, 23; 18:10;
   19:9. The church in heaven is represented as celebrating the
   triumphs of the Redeemer "harping with their harps" (Rev. 14:2).
