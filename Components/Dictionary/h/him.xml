   Note: When a collective noun or a class is referred to, he is
         of common gender. In early English, he referred to a
         feminine or neuter noun, or to one in the plural, as
         well as to noun in the masculine singular. In
         composition, he denotes a male animal; as, a he-goat.

   Note: In old English his and him were respectively the
         genitive and dative forms of it as well as of he. This
         use is now obsolete. Poetically, him is sometimes used
         with the reflexive sense of himself.
