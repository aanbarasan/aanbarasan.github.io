      <WordDefinition>Hand
   Called by Galen "the instrument of instruments." It is the
   symbol of human action (Ps. 9:16; Job 9:30; Isa. 1:15; 1 Tim.
   2:8). Washing the hands was a symbol of innocence (Ps. 26:6;
   73:13; Matt. 27:24), also of sanctification (1 Cor. 6:11; Isa.
   51:16; Ps. 24:3, 4). In Ps. 77:2 the correct rendering is, as in
   the Revised Version, "My hand was stretched out," etc., instead
   of, as in the Authorized Version, "My sore ran in the night,"
   etc.
   
     The right hand denoted the south, and the left the north (Job
   23:9; 1 Sam. 23:19). To give the right hand was a pledge of
   fidelity (2 Kings 10:15; Ezra 10:19); also of submission to the
   victors (Ezek. 17:18; Jer. 50:15). The right hand was lifted up
   in taking an oath (Gen. 14:22, etc.). The hand is frequently
   mentioned, particularly the right hand, as a symbol of power and
   strength (Ps. 60:5; Isa. 28:2). To kiss the hand is an act of
   homage (1 Kings 19:18; Job 31:27), and to pour water on one's
   hands is to serve him (2 Kings 3:11). The hand of God is the
   symbol of his power: its being upon one denotes favour (Ezra
   7:6, 28; Isa. 1:25; Luke 1:66, etc.) or punishment (Ex. 9:3;
   Judg. 2:15; Acts 13:11, etc.). A position at the right hand was
   regarded as the chief place of honour and power (Ps. 45:9;
   80:17; 110:1; Matt. 26:64).
