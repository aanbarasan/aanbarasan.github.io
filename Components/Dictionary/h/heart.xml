      <WordDefinition>HEART, n.  An automatic, muscular blood-pump.  Figuratively, this
useful organ is said to be the esat of emotions and sentiments -- a
very pretty fancy which, however, is nothing but a survival of a once
universal belief.  It is now known that the sentiments and emotions
reside in the stomach, being evolved from food by chemical action of
the gastric fluid.  The exact process by which a beefsteak becomes a
feeling -- tender or not, according to the age of the animal from
which it was cut; the successive stages of elaboration through which a
caviar sandwich is transmuted to a quaint fancy and reappears as a
pungent epigram; the marvelous functional methods of converting a
hard-boiled egg into religious contrition, or a cream-puff into a sigh
of sensibility -- these things have been patiently ascertained by M.
Pasteur, and by him expounded with convincing lucidity.  (See, also,
my monograph, _The Essential Identity of the Spiritual Affections and
Certain Intestinal Gases Freed in Digestion_ -- 4to, 687 pp.)  In a
scientific work entitled, I believe, _Delectatio Demonorum_ (John
Camden Hotton, London, 1873) this view of the sentiments receives a
striking illustration; and for further light consult Professor Dam's
famous treatise on _Love as a Product of Alimentary Maceration_.

      <WordDefinition>Heart
   According to the Bible, the heart is the centre not only of
   spiritual activity, but of all the operations of human life.
   "Heart" and "soul" are often used interchangeably (Deut. 6:5;
   26:16; comp. Matt. 22:37; Mark 12:30, 33), but this is not
   generally the case.
   
     The heart is the "home of the personal life," and hence a man
   is designated, according to his heart, wise (1 Kings 3:12,
   etc.), pure (Ps. 24:4; Matt. 5:8, etc.), upright and righteous
   (Gen. 20:5, 6; Ps. 11:2; 78:72), pious and good (Luke 8:15),
   etc. In these and such passages the word "soul" could not be
   substituted for "heart."
   
     The heart is also the seat of the conscience (Rom. 2:15). It
   is naturally wicked (Gen. 8:21), and hence it contaminates the
   whole life and character (Matt. 12:34; 15:18; comp. Eccl. 8:11;
   Ps. 73:7). Hence the heart must be changed, regenerated (Ezek.
   36:26; 11:19; Ps. 51:10-14), before a man can willingly obey
   God.
   
     The process of salvation begins in the heart by the believing
   reception of the testimony of God, while the rejection of that
   testimony hardens the heart (Ps. 95:8; Prov. 28:14; 2 Chr.
   36:13). "Hardness of heart evidences itself by light views of
   sin; partial acknowledgment and confession of it; pride and
   conceit; ingratitude; unconcern about the word and ordinances of
   God; inattention to divine providences; stifling convictions of
   conscience; shunning reproof; presumption, and general ignorance
   of divine things."

      <WordDefinition>Heart \Heart\ (h[aum]rt), n. [OE. harte, herte, heorte, AS.
   heorte; akin to OS. herta, OFies. hirte, D. hart, OHG. herza,
   G. herz, Icel. hjarta, Sw. hjerta, Goth. ha['i]rt[=o], Lith.
   szirdis, Russ. serdtse, Ir. cridhe, L. cor, Gr. kardi`a,
   kh^r. [root]277. Cf. {Accord}, {Discord}, {Cordial}, 4th
   {Core}, {Courage}.]
   1. (Anat.) A hollow, muscular organ, which, by contracting
      rhythmically, keeps up the circulation of the blood.
      [1913 Webster]

            Why does my blood thus muster to my heart! --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In adult mammals and birds, the heart is
         four-chambered, the right auricle and ventricle being
         completely separated from the left auricle and
         ventricle; and the blood flows from the systemic veins
         to the right auricle, thence to the right ventricle,
         from which it is forced to the lungs, then returned to
         the left auricle, thence passes to the left ventricle,
         from which it is driven into the systemic arteries. See
         Illust. under {Aorta}. In fishes there are but one
         auricle and one ventricle, the blood being pumped from
         the ventricle through the gills to the system, and
         thence returned to the auricle. In most amphibians and
         reptiles, the separation of the auricles is partial or
         complete, and in reptiles the ventricles also are
         separated more or less completely. The so-called lymph
         hearts, found in many amphibians, reptiles, and birds,
         are contractile sacs, which pump the lymph into the
         veins.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. The seat of the affections or sensibilities, collectively
      or separately, as love, hate, joy, grief, courage, and the
      like; rarely, the seat of the understanding or will; --
      usually in a good sense, when no epithet is expressed; the
      better or lovelier part of our nature; the spring of all
      our actions and purposes; the seat of moral life and
      character; the moral affections and character itself; the
      individual disposition and character; as, a good, tender,
      loving, bad, hard, or selfish heart.
      [1913 Webster]

            Hearts are dust, hearts' loves remain. --Emerson.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. The nearest the middle or center; the part most hidden and
      within; the inmost or most essential part of any body or
      system; the source of life and motion in any organization;
      the chief or vital portion; the center of activity, or of
      energetic or efficient action; as, the heart of a country,
      of a tree, etc.
      [1913 Webster]

            Exploits done in the heart of France. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            Peace subsisting at the heart
            Of endless agitation.                 --Wordsworth.

            The expelled nations take heart, and when they fly
            from one country invade another.      --Sir W.
                                                  Temple.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. Vigorous and efficient activity; power of fertile
      production; condition of the soil, whether good or bad.

                                                  --Dryden.
      [1913 Webster]

   6. That which resembles a heart in shape; especially, a
      roundish or oval figure or object having an obtuse point
      at one end, and at the other a corresponding indentation,
      -- used as a symbol or representative of the heart.

      figure or figures of a heart; as, hearts are trumps.
