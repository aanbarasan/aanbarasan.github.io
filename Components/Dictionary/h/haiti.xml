   Introduction Haiti
   ------------------
                            Background: One of the poorest countries in the
                                        Western Hemisphere, Haiti has been
                                        plagued by political violence for
                                        most of its history. Over three
                                        decades of dictatorship followed by
                                        military rule ended in 1990 when
                                        Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE was elected
                                        president. Most of his term was
                                        usurped by a military takeover, but
                                        he was able to return to office in
                                        1994 and oversee the installation of
                                        a close associate to the presidency
                                        in 1996. ARISTIDE won a second term
                                        as president in 2000, and took
                                        office early in 2001. However, a
                                        political crisis stemming from
                                        fraudulent legislative elections in
                                        2000 has not yet been resolved.

   Economy Haiti
   -------------
                    Economy - overview: About 80% of the population lives in
                                        abject poverty. Nearly 70% of all
                                        Haitians depend on the agriculture
                                        sector, which consists mainly of
                                        small-scale subsistence farming and
                                        employs about two-thirds of the
                                        economically active work force. The
                                        country has experienced little job
                                        creation since the former President
                                        PREVAL took office in February 1996,
                                        although the informal economy is
                                        growing. Following legislative
                                        elections in May 2000, fraught with
                                        irregularities, international donors
                                        - including the US and EU -
                                        suspended almost all aid to Haiti.
                                        The economy shrank an estimated 1.2%
                                        in 2001, and the contraction will
                                        likely intensify in 2002 unless a
                                        political agreement with donors is
                                        reached and aid restored.
