      <WordDefinition>highly adv. [scientific computation] The preferred modifier for
   overstating an understatement. As in: `highly nonoptimal', the worst
   possible way to do something; `highly nontrivial', either impossible or
   requiring a major research project; `highly nonlinear', completely
   erratic and unpredictable; `highly nontechnical', drivel written for
   {luser}s, oversimplified to the point of being misleading or incorrect
   (compare {drool-proof paper}). In other computing cultures, postfixing
   of {in the extreme} might be preferred.
