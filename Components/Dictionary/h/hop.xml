      <WordDefinition>hop
     
        1. &lt;messaging&gt; One point-to-point transmission in a series
        required to get a message from point A to point B on a {store
        and forward} network.  On such networks (including {UUCPNET}
        and {FidoNet}), an important inter-machine metric is the hop
        count of the shortest path between them.  This can be more
        significant than their geographical separation.
     
        Each {exclamation mark} in a {bang path} represents one hop.
     
        2. &lt;networking&gt; One direct host-to-host connection forming
        part of the route between two hosts in a {routed} {network}
        such as the {Internet}.  Some {protocols} place an upper limit
        on the hop count in order to detect routing loops.
     
        3. &lt;jargon, networking&gt; To {log in} to a {remote} computer,
        especially via {rlogin} or {telnet}.  "I'll hop over to foovax
        to FTP that."
