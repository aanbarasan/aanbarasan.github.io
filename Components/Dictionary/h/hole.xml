      <WordDefinition>hole
     
        &lt;electronics&gt; The absence of an {electron} in a
        {semiconductor} material.  In the {electron model}, a hole can
        be thought of as an incomplete outer electron shell in a
        doping substance.  Holes can also be thought of as positive
        charge carriers; while this is in a sense a fiction, it is a
        useful abstraction.

      <WordDefinition>hole n. A region in an otherwise {flat} entity which is not actually
   present. For example, some Unix filesystems can store large files with
   holes so that unused regions of the file are never actually stored on
   disk. (In techspeak, these are referred to as `sparse' files.) As
   another example, the region of memory in IBM PCs reserved for
   memory-mapped I/O devices which may not actually be present is called
   `the I/O hole', since memory-management systems must skip over this area
   when filling user requests for memory.
