      <WordDefinition>Hypothesis \Hy*poth"e*sis\, n.; pl. {Hypotheses}. [NL., fr. Gr.
   ? foundation, supposition, fr. ? to place under, ? under + ?
   to put. See {Hypo-}, {Thesis}.]
   1. A supposition; a proposition or principle which is
      supposed or taken for granted, in order to draw a
      conclusion or inference for proof of the point in
      question; something not proved, but assumed for the
      purpose of argument, or to account for a fact or an
      occurrence; as, the hypothesis that head winds detain an
      overdue steamer.
      [1913 Webster]

            An hypothesis being a mere supposition, there are no
            other limits to hypotheses than those of the human
            imagination.                          --J. S. Mill.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Natural Science) A tentative theory or supposition
      provisionally adopted to explain certain facts, and to
      guide in the investigation of others; hence, frequently
      called a working hypothesis.

   Syn: Supposition; assumption. See {Theory}.
        [1913 Webster]

   {Nebular hypothesis}. See under {Nebular}.
