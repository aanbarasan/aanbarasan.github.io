      <WordDefinition>heuristic
     
        1. &lt;programming&gt; A rule of thumb, simplification, or educated
        guess that reduces or limits the search for solutions in
        domains that are difficult and poorly understood.  Unlike
        {algorithms}, heuristics do not guarantee optimal, or even
        {feasible}, solutions and are often used with no theoretical
        guarantee.
     
        2. &lt;algorithm&gt; {approximation algorithm}.

      <WordDefinition>Heuristic \Heu*ris"tic\ (h[-u]*r[i^]s"t[i^]k), a. [Gr.
   e"yri`skein to discover.]
   1. Serving to promote discovery or learning; -- used
      especially of thories or paradigms which stimulate new
      ideas for discovering facts in experimental sciences.
      [1913 Webster +PJC]

   2. Serving to stimulate people to learn and discover on their
      own, especially by encouraging experimental and
      trial-and-error methods for solving problems.
      [PJC]

   3. Pertaining to or based on trial-and-error and experimental
      methods of learning and evaluation.
      [PJC]

   4. (Computers) Based on the use of an efficient trial-and
      error method to search a space of possible solutions to a
      problem, or to find an acceptable approximate solution,
      when an exact algorithmic method is unavailable or too
      time-consuming.
