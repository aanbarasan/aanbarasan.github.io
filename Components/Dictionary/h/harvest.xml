      <WordDefinition>Harvest
   the season for gathering grain or fruit. On the 16th day of Abib
   (or April) a handful of ripe ears of corn was offered as a
   first-fruit before the Lord, and immediately after this the
   harvest commenced (Lev. 23:9-14; 2 Sam. 21:9, 10; Ruth 2:23). It
   began with the feast of Passover and ended with Pentecost, thus
   lasting for seven weeks (Ex. 23:16). The harvest was a season of
   joy (Ps. 126:1-6; Isa. 9:3). This word is used figuratively
   Matt. 9:37; 13:30; Luke 10:2; John 4:35. (See {AGRICULTURE}.)
