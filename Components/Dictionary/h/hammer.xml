      <WordDefinition>Hammer
   (1.) Heb. pattish, used by gold-beaters (Isa. 41:7) and by
   quarry-men (Jer. 23:29). Metaphorically of Babylon (Jer. 50:23)
   or Nebuchadnezzar.
   
     (2.) Heb. makabah, a stone-cutter's mallet (1 Kings 6:7), or
   of any workman (Judg. 4:21; Isa. 44:12).
   
     (3.) Heb. halmuth, a poetical word for a workman's hammer,
   found only in Judg. 5:26, where it denotes the mallet with which
   the pins of the tent of the nomad are driven into the ground.
   
     (4.) Heb. mappets, rendered "battle-axe" in Jer. 51:20. This
   was properly a "mace," which is thus described by Rawlinson:
   "The Assyrian mace was a short, thin weapon, and must either
   have been made of a very tough wood or (and this is more
   probable) of metal. It had an ornamented head, which was
   sometimes very beautifully modelled, and generally a strap or
   string at the lower end by which it could be grasped with
   greater firmness."
