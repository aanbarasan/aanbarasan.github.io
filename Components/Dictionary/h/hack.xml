      <WordDefinition>hack
     
        &lt;jargon&gt; 1. Originally, a quick job that produces what is
        needed, but not well.
     
        2.  An incredibly good, and perhaps very time-consuming, piece
        of work that produces exactly what is needed.
     
        3. To bear emotionally or physically.  "I can't hack this
        heat!"
     
        4. To work on something (typically a program).  In an
        immediate sense: "What are you doing?"  "I'm hacking TECO."
        In a general (time-extended) sense: "What do you do around
        here?"  "I hack TECO."  More generally, "I hack "foo"" is
        roughly equivalent to ""foo" is my major interest (or
        project)".  "I hack solid-state physics."  See {Hacking X for
        Y}.
     
        5. To pull a prank on.  See {hacker}.
     
        6. To interact with a computer in a playful and exploratory
        rather than goal-directed way.  "Whatcha up to?"  "Oh, just
        hacking."
     
        7.  Short for {hacker}.
     
        8. See {nethack}.
     
        9. (MIT) To explore the basements, roof ledges, and steam
        tunnels of a large, institutional building, to the dismay of
        Physical Plant workers and (since this is usually performed at
        educational institutions) the Campus Police.  This activity
        has been found to be eerily similar to playing adventure games
        such as {Dungeons and Dragons} and {Zork}.  See also
        {vadding}.
     
        See also {neat hack}, {real hack}.

   time-consuming, piece of work that produces exactly what is needed. 3.
   vt. To bear emotionally or physically. "I can't hack this heat!" 4. vt.
   To work on something (typically a program). In an immediate sense: "What
   are you doing?" "I'm hacking TECO." In a general (time-extended) sense:
   "What do you do around here?" "I hack TECO." More generally, "I hack

   To pull a prank on. See sense 2 and {hacker} (sense 5). 6. vi. To

   Constructions on this term abound. They include `happy hacking' (a
   farewell), `how's hacking?' (a friendly greeting among hackers) and
   `hack, hack' (a fairly content-free but friendly comment, often used as
   a temporary farewell). For more on this totipotent term see "{The
   Meaning of Hack}". See also {neat hack}, {real hack}.
