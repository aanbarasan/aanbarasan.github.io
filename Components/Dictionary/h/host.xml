      <WordDefinition>Host
   an entertainer (Rom. 16:23); a tavern-keeper, the keeper of a
   caravansary (Luke 10:35).
   
     In warfare, a troop or military force. This consisted at first
   only of infantry. Solomon afterwards added cavalry (1 Kings
   4:26; 10:26). Every male Israelite from twenty to fifty years of
   age was bound by the law to bear arms when necessary (Num. 1:3;
   26:2; 2 Chr. 25:5).
   
     Saul was the first to form a standing army (1 Sam. 13:2;
   24:2). This example was followed by David (1 Chr. 27:1), and
   Solomon (1 Kings 4:26), and by the kings of Israel and Judah (2
   Chr. 17:14; 26:11; 2 Kings 11:4, etc.).
