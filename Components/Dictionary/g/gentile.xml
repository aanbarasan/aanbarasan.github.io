      <WordDefinition>Gentile \Gen"tile\ (j[e^]n"t[imac]l), n. [L. gentilis belonging
   to the same clan, stock, race, people, or nation; in
   opposition to {Roman}, a foreigner; in opposition to {Jew} or
   {Christian}, a heathen: cf. F. gentil. See {Gentle}, a.]
   1. One neither a Jew nor a Christian; a worshiper of false
      gods; a heathen.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. A person who is not Jewish; -- used in this sense by Jews.

   Syn: goy[male], shiksa[female].
        [PJC]

   Note: The Hebrews included in the term g[=o]yim, or nations,
         all the tribes of men who had not received the true
         faith, and were not circumcised. The Christians
         translated g[=o]yim by the L. gentes, and imitated the
         Jews in giving the name gentiles to all nations who
         were neither Jews nor Christians. In civil affairs, the
         denomination was given to all nations who were not
         Romans. As used by Mormons, the term gentile designates
         any person who is not a Mormon.

   Syn: Pagan; heathen. See {Pagan}.
        [1913 Webster]
