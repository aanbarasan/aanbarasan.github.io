      <WordDefinition>Greek
   Found only in the New Testament, where a distinction is observed
   between "Greek" and "Grecian" (q.v.). The former is (1) a Greek
   by race (Acts 16:1-3; 18:17; Rom. 1:14), or (2) a Gentile as
   opposed to a Jew (Rom. 2:9, 10). The latter, meaning properly
   "one who speaks Greek," is a foreign Jew opposed to a home Jew
   who dwelt in Palestine.
   
     The word "Grecians" in Acts 11:20 should be "Greeks," denoting
   the heathen Greeks of that city, as rendered in the Revised
   Version according to the reading of the best manuscripts
   ("Hellenes").

        1. &lt;text, graphics&gt; To display text as abstract dots and lines
        in order to give a preview of layout without actually being
        legible.  This is faster than drawing the characters correctly
        which may require scaling or other transformations.  Greeking
        is particularly useful when displaying a reduced image of a
        document where the text would be too small to be legible on
        the display anyway.
