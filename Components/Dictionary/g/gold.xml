      <WordDefinition>Gold
   (1.) Heb. zahab, so called from its yellow colour (Ex. 25:11; 1
   Chr. 28:18; 2 Chr. 3:5).
   
     (2.) Heb. segor, from its compactness, or as being enclosed or
   treasured up; thus precious or "fine gold" (1 Kings 6:20; 7:49).
   
     (3.) Heb. paz, native or pure gold (Job 28:17; Ps. 19:10;
   21:3, etc.).
   
     (4.) Heb. betzer, "ore of gold or silver" as dug out of the
   mine (Job 36:19, where it means simply riches).
   
     (5.) Heb. kethem, i.e., something concealed or separated (Job
   28:16,19; Ps. 45:9; Prov. 25:12). Rendered "golden wedge" in
   Isa. 13:12.
   
     (6.) Heb. haruts, i.e., dug out; poetic for gold (Prov. 8:10;
   16:16; Zech. 9:3).
   
     Gold was known from the earliest times (Gen. 2:11). It was
   principally used for ornaments (Gen. 24:22). It was very
   abundant (1 Chr. 22:14; Nah. 2:9; Dan. 3:1). Many tons of it
   were used in connection with the temple (2 Chr. 1:15). It was
   found in Arabia, Sheba, and Ophir (1 Kings 9:28; 10:1; Job
   28:16), but not in Palestine.
   
     In Dan. 2:38, the Babylonian Empire is spoken of as a "head of
   gold" because of its great riches; and Babylon was called by
   Isaiah (14:4) the "golden city" (R.V. marg., "exactress,"
   adopting the reading _marhebah_, instead of the usual word
   _madhebah_).

Symbol: Au
Atomic number: 79
Atomic weight: 196.96655
Gold is gold colored. It is the most malleable and ductile metal known.
There is only one stable isotope of gold, and five radioisotopes of gold,
Au-195 being the most stable with a half-life of 186 days. Gold is used
as a monetary standard, in jewelry, dentistry, electronics. Au-198 is used
in treating cancer and some other medical conditions. Gold has been known
to exist as far back as 2600 BC. Gold comes from the Anglo-Saxon word gold.
Its symbol, Au, comes from the Latin word aurum, which means gold. Gold is
not particularly toxic, however it is known to cause damage to the liver
and kidneys in some.

      <WordDefinition>Gold \Gold\ (g[=o]ld), n. [AS. gold; akin to D. goud, OS. &amp; G.
   gold, Icel. gull, Sw. &amp; Dan. guld, Goth. gul[thorn], Russ. &amp;
   OSlav. zlato; prob. akin to E. yellow. [root]49, 234. See
   {Yellow}, and cf. {Gild}, v. t.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. (Chem.) A metallic element of atomic number 79,
      constituting the most precious metal used as a common
      commercial medium of exchange. It has a characteristic
      yellow color, is one of the heaviest substances known
      (specific gravity 19.32), is soft, and very malleable and
      ductile. It is quite unalterable by heat (melting point
      1064.4[deg] C), moisture, and most corrosive agents, and
      therefore well suited for its use in coin and jewelry.
      Symbol Au ({Aurum}). Atomic weight 196.97.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Native gold contains usually eight to ten per cent of
         silver, but often much more. As the amount of silver
         increases, the color becomes whiter and the specific
         gravity lower. Gold is very widely disseminated, as in
         the sands of many rivers, but in very small quantity.
         It usually occurs in quartz veins (gold quartz), in
         slate and metamorphic rocks, or in sand and alluvial
         soil, resulting from the disintegration of such rocks.
         It also occurs associated with other metallic
         substances, as in auriferous pyrites, and is combined
         with tellurium in the minerals petzite, calaverite,
         sylvanite, etc. Pure gold is too soft for ordinary use,
         and is hardened by alloying with silver and copper, the
         latter giving a characteristic reddish tinge. [See
         {Carat}.] Gold also finds use in gold foil, in the
         pigment purple of Cassius, and in the chloride, which
         is used as a toning agent in photography.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. Money; riches; wealth.
      [1913 Webster]

            For me, the gold of France did not seduce. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. A yellow color, like that of the metal; as, a flower
      tipped with gold.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. Figuratively, something precious or pure; as, hearts of
      gold. --Shak.

      <WordDefinition>Watch \Watch\ (w[o^]ch), n. [OE. wacche, AS. w[ae]cce, fr.
   wacian to wake; akin to D. wacht, waak, G. wacht, wache.
   [root]134. See {Wake}, v. i. ]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. The act of watching; forbearance of sleep; vigil; wakeful,
      vigilant, or constantly observant attention; close
      observation; guard; preservative or preventive vigilance;
      formerly, a watching or guarding by night.
      [1913 Webster]

            Shepherds keeping watch by night.     --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

            All the long night their mournful watch they keep.
                                                  --Addison.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Watch was formerly distinguished from ward, the former
         signifying a watching or guarding by night, and the
         latter a watching, guarding, or protecting by day
         Hence, they were not unfrequently used together,
         especially in the phrase to keep watch and ward, to
         denote continuous and uninterrupted vigilance or
         protection, or both watching and guarding. This
         distinction is now rarely recognized, watch being used
         to signify a watching or guarding both by night and by
         day, and ward, which is now rarely used, having simply
         the meaning of guard, or protection, without reference
         to time.
         [1913 Webster]

               Still, when she slept, he kept both watch and
               ward.                              --Spenser.
         [1913 Webster]

               Ward, guard, or custodia, is chiefly applied to
               the daytime, in order to apprehend rioters, and
               robbers on the highway . . . Watch, is properly
               applicable to the night only, . . . and it begins
               when ward ends, and ends when that begins.
                                                  --Blackstone.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. One who watches, or those who watch; a watchman, or a body
      of watchmen; a sentry; a guard.
      [1913 Webster]

            make it as sure as ye can.            --Matt. xxvii.
                                                  65.

      [1913 Webster]

   4. The period of the night during which a person does duty as
      a sentinel, or guard; the time from the placing of a
      sentinel till his relief; hence, a division of the night.
      [1913 Webster]

            I did stand my watch upon the hill.   --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            Might we but hear . . .
            Or whistle from the lodge, or village cock
            Count the night watches to his feathery dames.
                                                  --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. A small timepiece, or chronometer, to be carried about the
