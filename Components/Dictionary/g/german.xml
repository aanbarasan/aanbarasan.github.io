      <WordDefinition>German
     
        &lt;human language&gt; \j*r'mn\ A human language written (in latin
        alphabet) and spoken in Germany, Austria and parts of
        Switzerland.
     
        German writing normally uses four non-{ASCII} characters:
        "aouï¿½", the first three have "umlauts" (two dots over the
        top): A O and U and the last is a double-S ("scharfes S")
        which looks like the Greek letter beta (except in capitalised
        words where it should be written "SS").  These can be written
        in ASCII in several ways, the most common are ae, oe ue AE OE
        UE ss or sz and the {TeX} versions "a "o "u "A "O "U "s.

   {High German}, the Teutonic dialect of Upper or Southern
      Germany, -- comprising Old High German, used from the 8th
      to the 11th century; Middle H. G., from the 12th to the
      15th century; and Modern or New H. G., the language of
      Luther's Bible version and of modern German literature.
      The dialects of Central Germany, the basis of the modern
      literary language, are often called Middle German, and the
      Southern German dialects Upper German; but High German is
      also used to cover both groups.

      German}), spoken in many dialects.
