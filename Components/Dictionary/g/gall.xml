      <WordDefinition>Gall
   (1) Heb. mererah, meaning "bitterness" (Job 16:13); i.e., the
   bile secreted in the liver. This word is also used of the poison
   of asps (20:14), and of the vitals, the seat of life (25).
   
     (2.) Heb. rosh. In Deut. 32:33 and Job 20:16 it denotes the
   poison of serpents. In Hos. 10:4 the Hebrew word is rendered
   "hemlock." The original probably denotes some bitter, poisonous
   plant, most probably the poppy, which grows up quickly, and is
   therefore coupled with wormwood (Deut. 29:18; Jer. 9:15; Lam.
   3:19). Comp. Jer. 8:14; 23:15, "water of gall," Gesenius, "poppy
   juice;" others, "water of hemlock," "bitter water."
   
     (3.) Gr. chole (Matt. 27:34), the LXX. translation of the
   Hebrew _rosh_ in Ps. 69; 21, which foretells our Lord's
   sufferings. The drink offered to our Lord was vinegar (made of
   light wine rendered acid, the common drink of Roman soldiers)
   "mingled with gall," or, according to Mark (15:23), "mingled
   with myrrh;" both expressions meaning the same thing, namely,
   that the vinegar was made bitter by the infusion of wormwood or
   some other bitter substance, usually given, according to a
   merciful custom, as an anodyne to those who were crucified, to
   render them insensible to pain. Our Lord, knowing this, refuses
   to drink it. He would take nothing to cloud his faculties or
   blunt the pain of dying. He chooses to suffer every element of
   woe in the bitter cup of agony given him by the Father (John
   18:11).
