      <WordDefinition>Gasoline \Gas"o*line\, Gasolene \Gas"o*lene\(? or ?; 104), n.
   A highly volatile mixture of fluid hydrocarbons, obtained
   mostly from petroleum, as also by the distillation of
   bituminous coal. It is used as a fuel for most automobiles
   and for many other vehicles with internal combustion engines.
   The gasoline of commerce is typically blended with additives
   to improve its performance in internal combustion engines.
   Gasoline was also used in the early 1900's in making air gas,
   and in giving illuminating power to water gas. See
   {Carburetor}.

   Syn: petrol[Brit]. [1913 Webster +PJC]
