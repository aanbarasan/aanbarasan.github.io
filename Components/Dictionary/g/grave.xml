      <WordDefinition>GRAVE, n.  A place in which the dead are laid to await the coming of
the medical student.

    Beside a lonely grave I stood --
        With brambles 'twas encumbered;
    The winds were moaning in the wood,
        Unheard by him who slumbered,

    A rustic standing near, I said:
        "He cannot hear it blowing!"
    "'Course not," said he:  "the feller's dead --
        He can't hear nowt [sic] that's going."

    "Too true," I said; "alas, too true --
        No sound his sense can quicken!"
    "Well, mister, wot is that to you? --
        The deadster ain't a-kickin'."

    I knelt and prayed:  "O Father, smile
        On him, and mercy show him!"
    That countryman looked on the while,
        And said:  "Ye didn't know him."

      <WordDefinition>Grave
   Among the ancient Hebrews graves were outside of cities in the
   open field (Luke 7:12; John 11:30). Kings (1 Kings 2:10) and
   prophets (1 Sam. 25:1) were generally buried within cities.
   Graves were generally grottoes or caves, natural or hewn out in
   rocks (Isa. 22:16; Matt. 27:60). There were family cemeteries
   (Gen. 47:29; 50:5; 2 Sam. 19:37). Public burial-places were
   assigned to the poor (Jer. 26:23; 2 Kings 23:6). Graves were
   usually closed with stones, which were whitewashed, to warn
   strangers against contact with them (Matt. 23:27), which caused
   ceremonial pollution (Num. 19:16).
   
     There were no graves in Jerusalem except those of the kings,
   and according to tradition that of the prophetess Huldah.

        sedate; weighty; momentous; important.

   Usage: {Grave}, {Sober}, {Serious}, {Solemn.} Sober supposes
          the absence of all exhilaration of spirits, and is
          opposed to gay or flighty; as, sober thought. Serious
          implies considerateness or reflection, and is opposed
          to jocose or sportive; as, serious and important
          concerns. Grave denotes a state of mind, appearance,
          etc., which results from the pressure of weighty
          interests, and is opposed to hilarity of feeling or
          vivacity of manner; as, a qrave remark; qrave attire.
          Solemn is applied to a case in which gravity is
          carried to its highest point; as, a solemn admonition;
          a solemn promise.
