   Note: In Great Britain, the term gentleman is applied in a
         limited sense to those having coats of arms, but who
         are without a title, and, in this sense, gentlemen hold
         a middle rank between the nobility and yeomanry. In a
         more extended sense, it includes every man above the
         rank of yeoman, comprehending the nobility. In the
         United States, the term is applied to men of education
         and good breeding of every occupation.
