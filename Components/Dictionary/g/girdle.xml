      <WordDefinition>Girdle
   (1.) Heb. hagor, a girdle of any kind worn by soldiers (1 Sam.
   18:4; 2 Sam. 20:8; 1 Kings 2:5; 2 Kings 3:21) or women (Isa.
   3:24).
   
     (2.) Heb. 'ezor, something "bound," worn by prophets (2 Kings
   1:8; Jer. 13:1), soldiers (Isa. 5:27; 2 Sam. 20:8; Ezek. 23:15),
   Kings (Job 12:18).
   
     (3.) Heb. mezah, a "band," a girdle worn by men alone (Ps.
   109:19; Isa. 22:21).
   
     (4.) Heb. 'abnet, the girdle of sacerdotal and state officers
   (Ex. 28:4, 39, 40; 29:9; 39:29).
   
     (5.) Heb. hesheb, the "curious girdle" (Ex. 28:8; R.V.,
   "cunningly woven band") was attached to the ephod, and was made
   of the same material.
   
     The common girdle was made of leather (2 Kings 1:8; Matt.
   3:4); a finer sort of linen (Jer. 13:1; Ezek. 16:10; Dan. 10:5).
   Girdles of sackcloth were worn in token of sorrow (Isa. 3:24;
   22:12). They were variously fastened to the wearer (Mark 1:6;
   Jer. 13:1; Ezek. 16:10).
   
     The girdle was a symbol of strength and power (Job 12:18, 21;
   30:11; Isa. 22:21; 45:5). "Righteousness and faithfulness" are
   the girdle of the Messiah (Isa. 11:5).
   
     Girdles were used as purses or pockets (Matt. 10:9. A. V.,
   "purses;" R.V., marg., "girdles." Also Mark 6:8).
