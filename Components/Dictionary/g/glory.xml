      <WordDefinition>Glory
   (Heb. kabhod; Gr. doxa). (1.) Abundance, wealth, treasure, and
   hence honour (Ps. 49:12); glory (Gen. 31:1; Matt. 4:8; Rev.
   21:24, 26).
   
     (2.) Honour, dignity (1 Kings 3:13; Heb. 2:7 1 Pet. 1:24); of
   God (Ps. 19:1; 29:1); of the mind or heart (Gen. 49:6; Ps. 7:5;
   Acts 2:46).
   
     (3.) Splendour, brightness, majesty (Gen. 45:13; Isa. 4:5;
   Acts 22:11; 2 Cor. 3:7); of Jehovah (Isa. 59:19; 60:1; 2 Thess.
   1:9).
   
     (4.) The glorious moral attributes, the infinite perfections
   of God (Isa. 40:5; Acts 7:2; Rom. 1:23; 9:23; Eph. 1:12). Jesus
   is the "brightness of the Father's glory" (Heb. 1:3; John 1:14;
   2:11).
   
     (5.) The bliss of heaven (Rom. 2:7, 10; 5:2; 8:18; Heb. 2:10;
   1 Pet. 5:1, 10).
   
     (6.) The phrase "Give glory to God" (Josh. 7:19; Jer. 13:16)
   is a Hebrew idiom meaning, "Confess your sins." The words of the
   Jews to the blind man, "Give God the praise" (John 9:24), are an
   adjuration to confess. They are equivalent to, "Confess that you
   are an impostor," "Give God the glory by speaking the truth;"
   for they denied that a miracle had been wrought.
