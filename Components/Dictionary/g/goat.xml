      <WordDefinition>Goat
   (1.) Heb. 'ez, the she-goat (Gen. 15:9; 30:35; 31:38). This
   Hebrew word is also used for the he-goat (Ex. 12:5; Lev. 4:23;
   Num. 28:15), and to denote a kid (Gen. 38:17, 20). Hence it may
   be regarded as the generic name of the animal as domesticated.
   It literally means "strength," and points to the superior
   strength of the goat as compared with the sheep.
   
     (2.) Heb. 'attud, only in plural; rendered "rams" (Gen.
   31:10,12); he-goats (Num. 7:17-88; Isa. 1:11); goats (Deut.
   32:14; Ps. 50:13). They were used in sacrifice (Ps. 66:15). This
   word is used metaphorically for princes or chiefs in Isa. 14:9,
   and in Zech. 10:3 as leaders. (Comp. Jer. 50:8.)
   
     (3.) Heb. gedi, properly a kid. Its flesh was a delicacy among
   the Hebrews (Gen. 27:9, 14, 17; Judg. 6:19).
   
     (4.) Heb. sa'ir, meaning the "shaggy," a hairy goat, a he-goat
   (2 Chr. 29:23); "a goat" (Lev. 4:24); "satyr" (Isa. 13:21);
   "devils" (Lev. 17:7). It is the goat of the sin-offering (Lev.
   9:3, 15; 10:16).
   
     (5.) Heb. tsaphir, a he-goat of the goats (2 Chr. 29:21). In
   Dan. 8:5, 8 it is used as a symbol of the Macedonian empire.
   
     (6.) Heb. tayish, a "striker" or "butter," rendered "he-goat"
   (Gen. 30:35; 32:14).
   
     (7.) Heb. 'azazel (q.v.), the "scapegoat" (Lev. 16:8, 10,26).
   
     (8.) There are two Hebrew words used to denote the
   undomesticated goat:, _Yael_, only in plural mountain goats (1
   Sam. 24:2; Job 39:1; Ps.104:18). It is derived from a word
   meaning "to climb." It is the ibex, which abounded in the
   mountainous parts of Moab. And _'akko_, only in Deut. 14:5, the
   wild goat.
   
     Goats are mentioned in the New Testament in Matt. 25:32,33;
   Heb. 9:12,13, 19; 10:4. They represent oppressors and wicked men
   (Ezek. 34:17; 39:18; Matt. 25:33).
   
     Several varieties of the goat were familiar to the Hebrews.
   They had an important place in their rural economy on account of
   the milk they afforded and the excellency of the flesh of the
   kid. They formed an important part of pastoral wealth (Gen.
   31:10, 12;32:14; 1 Sam. 25:2).

      <WordDefinition>Goat \Goat\ (g[=o]t), n. [OE goot, got, gat, AS. g[=a]t; akin to
   D. geit, OHG. geiz, G. geiss, Icel. geit, Sw. get, Dan. ged,
   Goth. gaits, L. haedus a young goat, kid.] (Zo["o]l.)
   A hollow-horned ruminant of the genus {Capra}, of several
   species and varieties, esp. the domestic goat ({Capra
   hircus}), which is raised for its milk, flesh, and skin.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The Cashmere and Angora varieties of the goat have
         long, silky hair, used in the manufacture of textile
         fabrics. The wild or bezoar goat ({Capra [ae]gagrus}),
         of Asia Minor, noted for the bezoar stones found in its
         stomach, is supposed to be one of the ancestral species
         of the domestic goat. The Rocky Mountain goat
         ({Haplocercus montanus}) is more nearly related to the
         antelopes. See {Mazame}.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Goat antelope} (Zo["o]l), one of several species of
      antelopes, which in some respects resemble a goat, having
      recurved horns, a stout body, large hoofs, and a short,
      flat tail, as the goral, thar, mazame, and chikara.

   {Goat fig} (Bot.), the wild fig.

   {Goat house}.
   (a) A place for keeping goats.
   (b) A brothel. [Obs.]

   {Goat moth} (Zo["o]l.), any moth of the genus {Cossus}, esp.
      the large European species ({Cossus ligniperda}), the
      larva of which burrows in oak and willow trees, and
      requires three years to mature. It exhales an odor like
      that of the he-goat.

   {Goat weed} (Bot.), a scrophulariaceous plant, of the genus
      {Capraria} ({Capraria biflora}).

   {Goat's bane} (Bot.), a poisonous plant ({Aconitum
      Lucoctonum}), bearing pale yellow flowers, introduced from
      Switzerland into England; wolfsbane.

   {Goat's foot} (Bot.), a kind of wood sorrel ({Oxalis
      caprina}) growing at the Cape of Good Hope.

   {Goat's rue} (Bot.), a leguminous plant ({Galega officinalis}
      of Europe, or {Tephrosia Virginiana} in the United
      States).

   {Goat's thorn} (Bot.), a thorny leguminous plant ({Astragalus
      Tragacanthus}), found in the Levant.

   {Goat's wheat} (Bot.), the genus {Tragopyrum} (now referred
      to {Atraphaxis}).
