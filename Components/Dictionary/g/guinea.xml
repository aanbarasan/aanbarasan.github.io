   Introduction Guinea
   -------------------
                            Background: Independent from France since 1958,
                                        Guinea did not hold democratic
                                        elections until 1993 when Gen.
                                        Lansana CONTE (head of the military
                                        government) was elected president of
                                        the civilian government. He was
                                        reelected in 1998. Unrest in Sierra
                                        Leone has spilled over into Guinea,
                                        threatening stability and creating a
                                        humanitarian emergency.

   Economy Guinea
   --------------
                    Economy - overview: Guinea possesses major mineral,
                                        hydropower, and agricultural
                                        resources, yet remains an
                                        underdeveloped nation. The country
                                        possesses over 30% of the world's
                                        bauxite reserves and is the second
                                        largest bauxite producer. The mining
                                        sector accounted for about 75% of
                                        exports in 1999. Long-run
                                        improvements in government fiscal
                                        arrangements, literacy, and the
                                        legal framework are needed if the
                                        country is to move out of poverty.
                                        The government made encouraging
                                        progress in budget management in
                                        1997-99, and reform progress was
                                        praised in the World Bank/IMF
                                        October 2000 assessment. However,
                                        escalating fighting along the Sierra
                                        Leonean and Liberian borders has
                                        caused major economic disruptions.
                                        In addition to direct defense costs,
                                        the violence has led to a sharp
                                        decline in investor confidence.
                                        Foreign mining companies have
                                        reduced expatriate staff, while
                                        panic buying has created food
                                        shortages and inflation in local
                                        markets. Multilateral aid -
