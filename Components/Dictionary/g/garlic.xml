      <WordDefinition>Garlic
   (Heb. shum, from its strong odour), mentioned only once (Num.
   11:5). The garlic common in Eastern countries is the Allium
   sativum or Allium Ascalonicum, so called from its having been
   brought into Europe from Ascalon by the Crusaders. It is now
   known by the name of "shallot" or "eschalot."
