      <WordDefinition>Gnat
   only in Matt. 23:24, a small two-winged stinging fly of the
   genus Culex, which includes mosquitoes. Our Lord alludes here to
   the gnat in a proverbial expression probably in common use, "who
   strain out the gnat;" the words in the Authorized Version,
   "strain at a gnat," being a mere typographical error, which has
   been corrected in the Revised Version. The custom of filtering
   wine for this purpose was common among the Jews. It was founded
   on Lev. 11:23. It is supposed that the "lice," Ex. 8:16 (marg.
   R.V., "sand-flies"), were a species of gnat.
