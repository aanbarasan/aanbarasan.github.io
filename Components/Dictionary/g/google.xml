        &lt;World-Wide Web&gt; The {World-Wide Web} {search engine} that
        indexes the greatest number of web pages - over two billion by
        December 2001 and provides a free service that searches this
        index in less than a second.
     
        The site's name is apparently derived from "{googol}", but
        note the difference in spelling.
     
        The "Google" spelling is also used in "The Hitchhikers Guide
        to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams, in which one of Deep
        Thought's designers asks, "And are you not," said Fook,
        leaning anxiously foward, "a greater analyst than the
        Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and
        Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single
        dust particle throughout a five-week Dangrabad Beta sand
        blizzard?"
     
        {Home (http://www.google.com/)}.

      <WordDefinition>google v. [common] To search the Web using the Google search engine,
   `http://www.google.com'. Google is highly esteemed among hackers for its
   significance ranking system, which is so uncannily effective that many
   hackers consider it to have rendered other search engines effectively
   irrelevant. The name `google' has additional flavor for hackers because
   most know that it was copied from a mathematical term for ten to the
   hundredth power, famously first uttered as `googol' by a mathematician's
   nine-year-old nephew.
