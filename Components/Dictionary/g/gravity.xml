      <WordDefinition>Gravity \Grav"i*ty\, n.; pl. {Gravities}. [L. gravitas, fr.
   gravis heavy; cf. F. gravit['e]. See {Grave}, a., {Grief}.]
   1. The state of having weight; beaviness; as, the gravity of
      lead.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Sobriety of character or demeanor. ``Men of gravity and
      learning.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Importance, significance, dignity, etc; hence,
      seriousness; enormity; as, the gravity of an offense.
      [1913 Webster]

            They derive an importance from . . . the gravity of
            the place where they were uttered.    --Burke.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. (Physics) The tendency of a mass of matter toward a center
      of attraction; esp., the tendency of a body toward the
      center of the earth; terrestrial gravitation.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. (Mus.) Lowness of tone; -- opposed to {acuteness}.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Center of gravity} See under {Center}.

   {Gravity battery}, See {Battery}, n., 4.

   {Specific gravity}, the ratio of the weight of a body to the
      weight of an equal volume of some other body taken as the
      standard or unit. This standard is usually water for
      solids and liquids, and air for gases. Thus, 19, the
      specific gravity of gold, expresses the fact that, bulk
      for bulk, gold is nineteen times as heavy as water.
      [1913 Webster]

      <WordDefinition>gravity
     n 1: (physics) the force of attraction between all masses in the
          universe; especially the attraction of the earth's mass
          for bodies near its surface; "the more remote the body
          the less the gravity"; "the gravitation between two
          bodies is proportional to the product of their masses
          and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
          between them"; "gravitation cannot be held responsible
          for people falling in love"--Albert Einstein [syn: {gravitation},
           {gravitational attraction}, {gravitational force}]
     2: a manner that is serious and solemn [syn: {graveness}, {sobriety},
         {soberness}, {somberness}]
     3: a solemn and dignified feeling [syn: {solemnity}] [ant: {levity}]
