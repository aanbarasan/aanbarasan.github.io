      <WordDefinition>giraffe \gi*raffe"\ (j[i^]*r[a^]f"; 277), n. [F. girafe, Sp.
   girafa, from Ar. zur[=a]fa, zar[=a]fa.] (Zo["o]l.)
   An African ruminant ({Giraffa camelopardalis} formerly
   {Camelopardalis giraffa}) related to the deers and antelopes,
   but placed in a family ({Giraffidae}) by itself; the
   camelopard. It is the tallest of quadriped animals, being
   sometimes twenty feet from the hoofs to the top of the head.
   Its neck is very long, and its fore legs are much longer than
   its hind legs. There are three types, having different
   patterns of spots on the pelt and different territories: the
   {Reticulated Giraffe}, the {Masai Giraffe}, and the {Uganda
   Giraffe}. Intermediate crosses are also observed.
