      <WordDefinition>Gaze \Gaze\ (g[=a]z), v. i. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Gazed} (g[=a]zd); p.
   pr. &amp; vb. n. {Gazing}.] [OE. gasen, akin to dial. Sw. gasa,
   cf. Goth. us-gaisjan to terrify, us-geisnan to be terrified.
   Cf. {Aghast}, {Ghastly}, {Ghost}, {Hesitate}.]
   To fix the eyes in a steady and earnest look; to look with
   eagerness or curiosity, as in admiration, astonishment, or
   with studious attention.
   [1913 Webster]

         Why stand ye gazing up into heaven?      --Acts i. 11.

   Syn: To gape; stare; look.

   Usage: To {Gaze}, {Gape}, {Stare}. To gaze is to look with
          fixed and prolonged attention, awakened by excited
          interest or elevated emotion; to gape is to look
          fixedly, with open mouth and feelings of ignorant
          wonder; to stare is to look with the fixedness of
          insolence or of idiocy. The lover of nature gazes with
          delight on the beauties of the landscape; the rustic
          gapes with wonder at the strange sights of a large
          city; the idiot stares on those around with a vacant
          look.
