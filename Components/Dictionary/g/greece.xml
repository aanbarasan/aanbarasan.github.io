      <WordDefinition>Greece
   orginally consisted of the four provinces of Macedonia, Epirus,
   Achaia, and Peleponnesus. In Acts 20:2 it designates only the
   Roman province of Macedonia. Greece was conquered by the Romans
   B.C. 146. After passing through various changes it was erected
   into an independent monarchy in 1831.
   
     Moses makes mention of Greece under the name of Javan (Gen.
   10:2-5); and this name does not again occur in the Old Testament
   till the time of Joel (3:6). Then the Greeks and Hebrews first
   came into contact in the Tyrian slave-market. Prophetic notice
   is taken of Greece in Dan. 8:21.
   
     The cities of Greece were the special scenes of the labours of
   the apostle Paul.

   Introduction Greece
   -------------------
                            Background: Greece achieved its independence
                                        from the Ottoman Empire in 1829.
                                        During the second half of the 19th
                                        century and the first half of the
                                        20th century, it gradually added
                                        neighboring islands and territories
                                        with Greek-speaking populations.
                                        Following the defeat of Communist
                                        rebels in 1949, Greece joined NATO
                                        in 1952. A military dictatorship,
                                        which in 1967 suspended many
                                        political liberties and forced the
                                        king to flee the country, lasted
                                        seven years. Democratic elections in
                                        1974 and a referendum created a
                                        parliamentary republic and abolished
                                        the monarchy; Greece joined the
                                        European Community or EC in 1981
                                        (which became the EU in 1992).

   Economy Greece
   --------------
                    Economy - overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist
                                        economy with the public sector
                                        accounting for about half of GDP.
                                        Tourism is a key industry, providing
                                        a large portion of GDP and foreign
                                        exchange earnings. Greece is a major
                                        beneficiary of EU aid, equal to
                                        about 3.3% of GDP. The economy has
                                        improved steadily over the last few
                                        years, as the government tightened
                                        policy in the run-up to Greece's
                                        entry into the EU's Economic and
                                        Monetary Union (EMU) on 1 January
                                        2001. Major challenges remaining
                                        include the reduction of
                                        unemployment and further
                                        restructuring of the economy,
                                        including privatizing several state
                                        enterprises, undertaking social
                                        security reforms, overhauling the
                                        tax system, and minimizing
                                        bureaucratic inefficiencies.
