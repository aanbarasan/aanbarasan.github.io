      <WordDefinition>Grass
   (1.) Heb. hatsir, ripe grass fit for mowing (1 Kings 18:5; Job
   40:15; Ps. 104:14). As the herbage rapidly fades under the
   scorching sun, it is used as an image of the brevity of human
   life (Isa. 40:6, 7; Ps. 90:5). In Num. 11:5 this word is
   rendered "leeks."
   
     (2.) Heb. deshe', green grass (Gen. 1:11, 12; Isa. 66:14;
   Deut. 32:2). "The sickly and forced blades of grass which spring
   up on the flat plastered roofs of houses in the East are used as
   an emblem of speedy destruction, because they are small and
   weak, and because, under the scorching rays of the sun, they
   soon wither away" (2 Kings 19:26; Ps. 129:6; Isa. 37:27).
   
     The dry stalks of grass were often used as fuel for the oven
   (Matt. 6:30; 13:30; Luke 12:28).
