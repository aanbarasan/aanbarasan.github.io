      <WordDefinition>Grove
   (1.) Heb. 'asherah, properly a wooden image, or a pillar
   representing Ashtoreth, a sensual Canaanitish goddess, probably
   usually set up in a grove (2 Kings 21:7; 23:4). In the Revised
   Version the word "Asherah" (q.v.) is introduced as a proper
   noun, the name of the wooden symbol of a goddess, with the
   plurals Asherim (Ex. 34:13) and Asheroth (Judg. 3:13).
   
     The LXX. have rendered _asherah_ in 2 Chr. 15:16 by "Astarte."
   The Vulgate has done this also in Judg. 3:7.
   
     (2.) Heb. 'eshel (Gen. 21:33). In 1 Sam. 22:6 and 31:13 the
   Authorized Version renders this word by "tree." In all these
   passages the Revised Version renders by "tamarisk tree." It has
   been identified with the Tamariscus orientalis, five species of
   which are found in Palestine.
   
     (3.) The Heb. word 'elon, uniformly rendered in the Authorized
   Version by "plain," properly signifies a grove or plantation. In
   the Revised Version it is rendered, pl., "oaks" (Gen. 13:18;
   14:13; 18:1; 12:6; Deut. 11:30; Josh. 19:33). In the earliest
   times groves are mentioned in connection with religious worship.
   The heathen consecrated groves to particular gods, and for this
   reason they were forbidden to the Jews (Jer. 17:3; Ezek. 20:28).

      <WordDefinition>Grove \Grove\ (gr[=o]v), n. [AS. graf, fr. grafan to dig. The
   original sense seems to have been a lane cut through trees.
   See {Grave}, v., and cf. {Groove}.]
   A smaller group of trees than a forest, and without
   underwood, planted, or growing naturally as if arranged by
   art; a wood of small extent.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The Hebrew word Asherah, rendered grove in the
         Authorized Version of the Bible, is left untranslated
         in the Revised Version. Almost all modern interpreters
         agree that by Asherah an idol or image of some kind is
         intended.
         [1913 Webster]
