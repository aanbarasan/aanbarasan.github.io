   Introduction Germany
   --------------------
                            Background: As Europe's largest economy and most
                                        populous nation, Germany remains a
                                        key member of the continent's
                                        economic, political, and defense
                                        organizations. European power
                                        struggles immersed the country in
                                        two devastating World Wars in the
                                        first half of the 20th century and
                                        left the country occupied by the
                                        victorious Allied powers of the US,
                                        UK, France, and the Soviet Union in
                                        1945. With the advent of the Cold
                                        War, two German states were formed
                                        in 1949: the western Federal
                                        Republic of Germany (FRG) and the
                                        eastern German Democratic Republic
                                        (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded
                                        itself in key Western economic and
                                        security organizations, the EC,
                                        which became the EU, and NATO, while
                                        the communist GDR was on the front
                                        line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
                                        The decline of the USSR and the end
                                        of the Cold War allowed for German
                                        unification in 1990. Since then
                                        Germany has expended considerable
                                        funds to bring eastern productivity
                                        and wages up to western standards.
                                        In January 2002, Germany and 11
                                        other EU countries introduced a
                                        common European currency, the euro.

   Economy Germany
   ---------------
                    Economy - overview: Germany's affluent and
                                        technologically powerful economy
                                        turned in a relatively weak
                                        performance throughout much of the
                                        1990s. The modernization and
                                        integration of the eastern German
                                        economy continues to be a costly
                                        long-term problem, with annual
                                        transfers from west to east
                                        amounting to roughly $70 billion.
                                        Germany's ageing population,
                                        combined with high unemployment, has
                                        pushed social security outlays to a
                                        level exceeding contributions from
                                        workers. Structural rigidities in
                                        the labor market - including strict
                                        regulations on laying off workers
                                        and the setting of wages on a
                                        national basis - have made
                                        unemployment a chronic problem.
                                        Business and income tax cuts
                                        introduced in 2001 did not spare
                                        Germany from the impact of the
                                        downturn in international trade, and
                                        domestic demand faltered as
                                        unemployment began to rise. The
                                        government expects growth to gain
                                        pace in the second half of 2002, but
                                        to fall short of 1% for the year
                                        again. Corporate restructuring and
                                        growing capital markets are setting
                                        the foundations that could allow
                                        Germany to meet the long-term
                                        challenges of European economic
                                        integration and globalization,
                                        particularly if labor market
                                        rigidities are addressed.
