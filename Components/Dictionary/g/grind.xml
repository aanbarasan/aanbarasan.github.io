      <WordDefinition>Grind
   (Ex. 32:20; Deut. 9:21; Judg. 16:21), to crush small (Heb.
   tahan); to oppress the poor (Isa. 3:5). The hand-mill was early
   used by the Hebrews (Num. 11:8). It consisted of two stones, the
   upper (Deut. 24:6; 2 Sam. 11:21) being movable and slightly
   concave, the lower being stationary. The grinders mentioned
   Eccl. 12:3 are the teeth. (See {MILL}.)

      <WordDefinition>grind
     
        1. (MIT and Berkeley) To prettify hardcopy of code, especially
        LISP code, by reindenting lines, printing keywords and
        comments in distinct fonts (if available), etc.  This usage
        was associated with the MacLISP community and is now rare;
        {prettyprint} was and is the generic term for such operations.
     
        2. (Unix) To generate the formatted version of a document from
        the {nroff}, {troff}, {TeX}, or Scribe source.
     
        3. To run seemingly interminably, especially (but not
        necessarily) if performing some tedious and inherently useless
        task.  Similar to {crunch} or {grovel}.  Grinding has a
        connotation of using a lot of CPU time, but it is possible to
        grind a disk, network, etc.
     
        See also {hog}.
     
        4. To make the whole system slow.  "Troff really grinds a
        PDP-11."
     
        5. "grind grind" excl. Roughly, "Isn't the machine slow
        today!"
