      <WordDefinition>Generation
   Gen. 2:4, "These are the generations," means the "history." 5:1,
   "The book of the generations," means a family register, or
   history of Adam. 37:2, "The generations of Jacob" = the history
   of Jacob and his descendants. 7:1, "In this generation" = in
   this age. Ps. 49:19, "The generation of his fathers" = the
   dwelling of his fathers, i.e., the grave. Ps. 73:15, "The
   generation of thy children" = the contemporary race. Isa. 53:8,
   "Who shall declare his generation?" = His manner of life who
   shall declare? or rather = His race, posterity, shall be so
   numerous that no one shall be able to declare it.
   
     In Matt. 1:17, the word means a succession or series of
   persons from the same stock. Matt. 3:7, "Generation of vipers" =
   brood of vipers. 24:34, "This generation" = the persons then
   living contemporary with Christ. 1 Pet. 2:9, "A chosen
   generation" = a chosen people.
   
     The Hebrews seem to have reckoned time by the generation. In
   the time of Abraham a generation was an hundred years, thus:
   Gen. 15:16, "In the fourth generation" = in four hundred years
   (comp. verse 13 and Ex. 12:40). In Deut. 1:35 and 2:14 a
   generation is a period of thirty-eight years.

      <WordDefinition>Generation \Gen`er*a"tion\, n. [OE. generacioun, F.

      [1913 Webster]

   6. (Geom.) The formation or production of any geometrical

      in accordance with a mathematical law, of a point or a
      magnitude; as, the generation of a line or curve by the
      motion of a point, of a surface by a line, a sphere by a
      semicircle, etc.
      [1913 Webster]

   7. (Biol.) The aggregate of the functions and phenomene which
      attend reproduction.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: There are four modes of generation in the animal
         kingdom: scissiparity or by fissiparous generation,
         gemmiparity or by budding, germiparity or by germs, and
         oviparity or by ova.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Alternate generation} (Biol.), alternation of sexual with
      asexual generation, in which the products of one process
      differ from those of the other, -- a form of reproduction
      common both to animal and vegetable organisms. In the
      simplest form, the organism arising from sexual generation
      produces offspiring unlike itself, agamogenetically.
      These, however, in time acquire reproductive organs, and
      from their impregnated germs the original parent form is
      reproduced. In more complicated cases, the first series of
      organisms produced agamogenetically may give rise to
      others by a like process, and these in turn to still other
      generations. Ultimately, however, a generation is formed
      which develops sexual organs, and the original form is
      reproduced.

   {Spontaneous generation} (Biol.), the fancied production of
      living organisms without previously existing parents from
      inorganic matter, or from decomposing organic matter, a
      notion which at one time had many supporters; abiogenesis.
      [1913 Webster]
