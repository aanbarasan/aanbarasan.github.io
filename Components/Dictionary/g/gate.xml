      <WordDefinition>Gate
   (1.) Of cities, as of Jerusalem (Jer. 37:13; Neh. 1:3; 2:3;
   3:3), of Sodom (Gen. 19:1), of Gaza (Judg. 16:3).
   
     (2.) Of royal palaces (Neh. 2:8).
   
     (3.) Of the temple of Solomon (1 Kings 6:34, 35; 2 Kings
   18:16); of the holy place (1 Kings 6:31, 32; Ezek. 41:23, 24);
   of the outer courts of the temple, the beautiful gate (Acts
   3:2).
   
     (4.) Tombs (Matt. 27:60).
   
     (5.) Prisons (Acts 12:10; 16:27).
   
     (6.) Caverns (1 Kings 19:13).
   
     (7.) Camps (Ex. 32:26, 27; Heb. 13:12).
   
     The materials of which gates were made were,
   
     (1.) Iron and brass (Ps. 107:16; Isa. 45:2; Acts 12:10).
   
     (2.) Stones and pearls (Isa. 54:12; Rev. 21:21).
   
     (3.) Wood (Judg. 16:3) probably.
   
     At the gates of cities courts of justice were frequently held,
   and hence "judges of the gate" are spoken of (Deut. 16:18; 17:8;
   21:19; 25:6, 7, etc.). At the gates prophets also frequently
   delivered their messages (Prov. 1:21; 8:3; Isa. 29:21; Jer.
   17:19, 20; 26:10). Criminals were punished without the gates (1
   Kings 21:13; Acts 7:59). By the "gates of righteousness" we are
   probably to understand those of the temple (Ps. 118:19). "The
   gates of hell" (R.V., "gates of Hades") Matt. 16:18, are
   generally interpreted as meaning the power of Satan, but
   probably they may mean the power of death, denoting that the
   Church of Christ shall never die.

      <WordDefinition>gate
     
        &lt;hardware&gt; A low-level {digital} logic component.  Gates
        perform {Boolean} {functions} (e.g. {AND}, {NOT}), store
        {bit}s of data (e.g. a {flip-flop}), and connect and
        disconnect various parts of the overall circuit to control the
        flow of data ({tri-state} buffer).
     
        In a {CPU}, the term applies particularly to the buffers that
        route data between the various {functional units}.  Each gate
        allows data to flow from one unit to another or enables data
        from one output onto a certain {bus}.
