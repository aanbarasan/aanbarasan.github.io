   Introduction Guatemala
   ----------------------
                            Background: Guatemala was freed of Spanish
                                        colonial rule in 1821. During the
                                        second half of the 20th century, it
                                        experienced a variety of military
                                        and civilian governments as well as
                                        a 36-year guerrilla war. In 1996,
                                        the government signed a peace
                                        agreement formally ending the
                                        conflict, which had led to the death
                                        of more than 100,000 people and had
                                        created some 1 million refugees.

   Economy Guatemala
   -----------------
                    Economy - overview: The agricultural sector accounts for
                                        about one-fourth of GDP, two-thirds
                                        of exports, and half of the labor
                                        force. Coffee, sugar, and bananas
                                        are the main products. Former
                                        President ARZU (1996-2000) worked to
                                        implement a program of economic
                                        liberalization and political
                                        modernization. The 1996 signing of
                                        the peace accords, which ended 36
                                        years of civil war, removed a major
                                        obstacle to foreign investment. In
                                        1998, Hurricane Mitch caused
                                        relatively little damage to
                                        Guatemala compared to its neighbors.
                                        Ongoing challenges include
                                        increasing government revenues,
                                        negotiating further assistance from
                                        international donors, and increasing
                                        the efficiency and openness of both
                                        government and private financial
                                        operations. Despite low
                                        international prices for Guatemala's
                                        main commodities, the economy grew
                                        by 3% in 2000 and 2.3% in 2001.
                                        Guatemala, along with Honduras and
                                        El Salvador, recently concluded a
                                        free trade agreement with Mexico and
                                        has moved to protect international
                                        property rights. However, the
                                        PORTILLO administration has
                                        undertaken a review of
                                        privatizations under the previous
                                        administration, thereby creating
                                        some uncertainty among investors.
