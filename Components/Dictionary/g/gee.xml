      <WordDefinition>Gee \Gee\, v. i. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Geed}; p. pr. &amp; vb. n.
   {Geeing}.]
   1. To agree; to harmonize. [Colloq. or Prov. Eng.] --Forby.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. [Cf. G. j["u], interj., used in calling to a horse, It.
      gi[`o], F. dia, used to turn a horse to the left.] To turn
      to the off side, or from the driver (i.e., in the United
      States, to the right side); -- said of cattle, or a team;
      used most frequently in the imperative, often with off, by
      drivers of oxen, in directing their teams, and opposed to
      haw, or hoi. [Written also {jee}.]
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In England, the teamster walks on the right-hand side
         of the cattle; in the United States, on the left-hand
         side. In all cases, however, gee means to turn from the
         driver, and haw to turn toward him.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Gee ho}, or {Gee whoa}. Same as {Gee}.
      [1913 Webster]
