   {Geneva Bible}, a translation of the Bible into English, made
      and published by English refugees in Geneva (Geneva, 1560;
      London, 1576). It was the first English Bible printed in
      Roman type instead of the ancient black letter, the first
      which recognized the division into verses, and the first
      which omitted the Apocrypha. In form it was a small
      quarto, and soon superseded the large folio of Cranmer's
      translation. Called also {Genevan Bible}.

   {Geneva convention} (Mil.), an agreement made by
      representatives of the great continental powers at Geneva
      and signed in 1864, establishing new and more humane
      regulation regarding the treatment of the sick and wounded
      and the status of those who minister to them in war.
      Ambulances and military hospitals are made neutral, and
      this condition affects physicians, chaplains, nurses, and
      the ambulance corps. Great Britain signed the convention
      in 1865.

   {Geneva cross} (Mil.), a red Greek cross on a white ground;
      -- the flag and badge adopted in the Geneva convention.
