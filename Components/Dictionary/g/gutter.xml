      <WordDefinition>Gutter
   Heb. tsinnor, (2 Sam. 5:8). This Hebrew word occurs only
   elsewhere in Ps. 42:7 in the plural, where it is rendered
   "waterspouts." It denotes some passage through which water
   passed; a water-course.
   
     In Gen. 30:38, 41 the Hebrew word rendered "gutters" is
   _rahat_, and denotes vessels overflowing with water for cattle
   (Ex. 2:16); drinking-troughs.
