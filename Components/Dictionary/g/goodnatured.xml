   Usage: Good-natured denotes a disposition to please and be
          pleased. Good-tempered denotes a habit of mind which
          is not easily ruffled by provocations or other
          disturbing influences. Good-humored is applied to a
          spirit full of ease and cheerfulness, as displayed in
          one's outward deportment and in social intercourse. A
          good-natured man recommends himself to all by the
          spirit which governs him. A good-humored man
          recommends himself particularly as a companion. A
          good-tempered man is rarely betrayed into anything
          which can disturb the serenity of the social circle.
