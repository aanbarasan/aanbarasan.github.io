   promise, assurance. See {Grant}, v. t.]

   Note: Formerly, in English law, the term was specifically
         applied to transfers of incorporeal hereditaments,
         expectant estates, and letters patent from government
         and such is its present application in some of the
         United States. But now, in England the usual mode of
         transferring realty is by grant; and so, in some of the
         United States, the term grant is applied to conveyances
         of every kind of real property. --Bouvier. --Burrill.
