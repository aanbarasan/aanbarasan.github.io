      <WordDefinition>GOOSE, n.  A bird that supplies quills for writing.  These, by some
occult process of nature, are penetrated and suffused with various
degrees of the bird's intellectual energies and emotional character,
so that when inked and drawn mechanically across paper by a person
called an "author," there results a very fair and accurate transcript
of the fowl's thought and feeling.  The difference in geese, as
discovered by this ingenious method, is considerable:  many are found
to have only trivial and insignificant powers, but some are seen to be
very great geese indeed.

      <WordDefinition>Goose \Goose\ (g[=oo]s), n.; pl. {Geese} (g[=e]s). [OE. gos, AS.
   g[=o]s, pl. g[=e]s; akin to D. &amp; G. gans, Icel. g[=a]s, Dan.
   gaas, Sw. g[*a]s, Russ. guse. OIr. geiss, L. anser, for
   hanser, Gr. chh`n, Skr. ha[.m]sa. [root]233. Cf. {Gander},
   {Gannet}, {Ganza}, {Gosling}.] (Zo["o]l.)
   [1913 Webster]
   1. Any large web-footen bird of the subfamily {Anserin[ae]},
      and belonging to {Anser}, {Branta}, {Chen}, and several
      allied genera. See {Anseres}.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The common domestic goose is believed to have been
         derived from the European graylag goose ({Anser
         anser}). The bean goose ({A. segetum}), the American
         wild or Canada goose ({Branta Canadensis}), and the
         bernicle goose ({Branta leucopsis}) are well known
         species. The American white or snow geese and the blue
         goose belong to the genus {Chen}. See {Bernicle},
         {Emperor goose}, under {Emperor}, {Snow goose}, {Wild
         goose}, {Brant}.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. Any large bird of other related families, resembling the
      common goose.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The Egyptian or fox goose ({Alopochen [AE]gyptiaca})
         and the African spur-winged geese ({Plectropterus})
         belong to the family {Plectropterid[ae]}. The
         Australian semipalmated goose ({Anseranas semipalmata})
         and Cape Barren goose ({Cereopsis
         Nov[ae]-Hollandi[ae]}) are very different from northern
         geese, and each is made the type of a distinct family.
         Both are domesticated in Australia.
         [1913 Webster]

   3. A tailor's smoothing iron, so called from its handle,
      which resembles the neck of a goose.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. A silly creature; a simpleton.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. A game played with counters on a board divided into
      compartments, in some of which a goose was depicted.
      [1913 Webster]

            The pictures placed for ornament and use,
            The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose.
                                                  --Goldsmith.
      [1913 Webster]
