   Syn: Pleased; gratified; exhilarated; animated; delighted;
        happy; cheerful; joyous; joyful; cheering; exhilarating;
        pleasing; animating.

   Usage: {Glad}, {Delighted}, {Gratified}. Delighted expresses
          a much higher degree of pleasure than glad. Gratified
          always refers to a pleasure conferred by some human
          agent, and the feeling is modified by the
          consideration that we owe it in part to another. A
          person may be glad or delighted to see a friend, and
          gratified at the attention shown by his visits.
