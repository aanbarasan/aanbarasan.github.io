   {Specific gravity}, the ratio of the weight of a body to the
      weight of an equal volume of some other body taken as the
      standard or unit. This standard is usually water for
      solids and liquids, and air for gases. Thus, 19, the
      specific gravity of gold, expresses the fact that, bulk
      for bulk, gold is nineteen times as heavy as water.
      [1913 Webster]
