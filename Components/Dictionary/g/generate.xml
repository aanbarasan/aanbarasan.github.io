      <WordDefinition>generate vt. To produce something according to an algorithm or program
   or set of rules, or as a (possibly unintended) side effect of the
   execution of an algorithm or program. The opposite of {parse}. This term
   retains its mechanistic connotations (though often humorously) when used
   of human behavior. "The guy is rational most of the time, but mention
   nuclear energy around him and he'll generate {infinite} flamage."
