      <WordDefinition>Gender \Gen"der\ (j[e^]n"d[~e]r), n. [OF. genre, gendre (with
   excrescent d.), F.genre, fr. L. genus, generis, birth,
   descent, race, kind, gender, fr. the root of genere, gignere,
   to beget, in pass., to be born, akin to E. kin. See {Kin},
   and cf. {Generate}, {Genre}, {Gentle}, {Genus}.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. Kind; sort. [Obs.] ``One gender of herbs.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Sex, male or female.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The use of the term gender to refer to the sex of an
         animal, especially a person, was once common, then fell
         into disuse as the term became used primarily for the
         distinction of grammatical declension forms in
         inflected words. In the late 1900's, the term again
         became used to refer to the sex of people, as a
         euphemism for the term {sex}, especially in discussions
         of laws and policies on equal treatment of sexes.
         Objections by prescriptivists that the term should be
         used only in a grammatical context ignored the earlier
         uses.
         [PJC]

   3. (Gram.) A classification of nouns, primarily according to
      sex; and secondarily according to some fancied or imputed
      quality associated with sex.
      [1913 Webster]

            Gender is a grammatical distinction and applies to
            words only. Sex is natural distinction and applies
            to living objects.                    --R. Morris.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Adjectives and pronouns are said to vary in gender when
         the form is varied according to the gender of the words
         to which they refer.

      <WordDefinition>gender
     n 1: a grammatical category in inflected languages governing the
          agreement between nouns and pronouns and adjectives; in
          some languages it is quite arbitrary but in
          Indo-European languages it is usually based on sex or
          animateness [syn: {grammatical gender}]
     2: the properties that distinguish organisms on the basis of
        their reproductive roles; "she didn't want to know the sex
        of the foetus" [syn: {sex}, {sexuality}]
