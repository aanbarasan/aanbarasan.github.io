   Introduction Georgia
   --------------------
                            Background: Georgia was absorbed into the
                                        Russian Empire in the 19th century.
                                        Independent for three years (1918-
                                        1921) following the Russian
                                        revolution, it was forcibly
                                        incorporated into the USSR until the
                                        Soviet Union dissolved in 1991.
                                        Ethnic separation in Abkhazia and
                                        South Ossetia, poor governance, and
                                        Russian military bases deny the
                                        government effective control over
                                        the entirety of the state's
                                        internationally recognized
                                        territory. Despite myriad problems,
                                        progress on market reforms and
                                        democratization support the
                                        country's goal of greater
                                        integration with Western political,
                                        economic and security institutions.

   Economy Georgia
   ---------------
                    Economy - overview: Georgia's main economic activities
                                        include the cultivation of
                                        agricultural products such as citrus
                                        fruits, tea, hazelnuts, and grapes;
                                        mining of manganese and copper; and
                                        output of a small industrial sector
                                        producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic
                                        beverages, metals, machinery, and
                                        chemicals. The country imports the
                                        bulk of its energy needs, including
                                        natural gas and oil products. Its
                                        only sizable internal energy
                                        resource is hydropower. Despite the
                                        severe damage the economy has
                                        suffered due to civil strife,
                                        Georgia, with the help of the IMF
                                        and World Bank, has made substantial
                                        economic gains since 1995, achieving
                                        positive GDP growth and curtailing
                                        inflation. However, the Georgian
                                        government suffers from limited
                                        resources due to a chronic failure
                                        to collect tax revenues. Georgia
                                        also suffers from energy shortages;
                                        it privatized the T'bilisi
                                        distribution network in 1998, but
                                        collection rates are low, making the
                                        venture unprofitable. The country is
                                        pinning its hopes for long-term
                                        recovery on its role as a transit
                                        state for pipelines and trade. The
                                        start of construction on the Baku-
                                        T'bilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in summer
                                        2002 will bring much-needed
                                        investment and job opportunities to
                                        the country.
