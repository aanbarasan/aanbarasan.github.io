   {High German}, the Teutonic dialect of Upper or Southern
      Germany, -- comprising Old High German, used from the 8th
      to the 11th century; Middle H. G., from the 12th to the
      15th century; and Modern or New H. G., the language of
      Luther's Bible version and of modern German literature.
      The dialects of Central Germany, the basis of the modern
      literary language, are often called Middle German, and the
      Southern German dialects Upper German; but High German is
      also used to cover both groups.

      Netherlands, -- including {Friesic}; {Anglo-Saxon} or
      {Saxon}; {Old Saxon}; {Dutch} or {Low Dutch}, with its
      dialect, {Flemish}; and {Plattdeutsch} (called also {Low
      German}), spoken in many dialects.
      [1913 Webster]
