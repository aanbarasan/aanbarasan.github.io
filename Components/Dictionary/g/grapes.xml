      <WordDefinition>Grapevine \Grape"vine`\, n. (Bot.)
   A vine or climbing shrub, of the genus {Vitis}, having small
   green flowers and lobed leaves, and bearing the fruit called
   {grapes}.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The common grapevine of the Old World is {Vitis
         vinifera}, and is a native of Central Asia. Another
         variety is that yielding small seedless grapes commonly
         called {Zante currants}. The northern {Fox grape} of
         the United States is the {V. Labrusca}, from which, by
         cultivation, has come the Isabella variety. The
         southern {Fox grape}, or {Muscadine}, is the {V.
         vulpina}. The {Frost grape} is {V. cordifolia}, which
         has very fragrant flowers, and ripens after the early
         frosts.
