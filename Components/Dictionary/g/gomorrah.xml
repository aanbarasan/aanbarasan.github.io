      <WordDefinition>Gomorrah
   submersion, one of the five cities of the plain of Siddim (q.v.)
   which were destroyed by fire (Gen. 10:19; 13:10; 19:24, 28).
   These cities probably stood close together, and were near the
   northern extremity of what is now the Dead Sea. This city is
   always mentioned next after Sodom, both of which were types of
   impiety and wickedness (Gen. 18:20; Rom. 9:29). Their
   destruction is mentioned as an "ensample unto those that after
   should live ungodly" (2 Pet. 2:6; Jude 1:4-7). Their wickedness
   became proverbial (Deut. 32:32; Isa. 1:9, 10; Jer. 23:14). But
   that wickedness may be exceeded (Matt. 10:15; Mark 6:11). (See
   DEAD {SEA}).
