      <WordDefinition>Granite \Gran"ite\ (gr[a^]n"[i^]t), n. [It. granito granite,
   adj., grainy, p. p. of granire to make grainy, fr. L. granum
   grain; cf. F. granit. See {Grain}.] (Geol.)
   A crystalline, granular rock, consisting of quartz, feldspar,
   and mica, and usually of a whitish, grayish, or flesh-red
   color. It differs from gneiss in not having the mica in
   planes, and therefore in being destitute of a schistose
   structure.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Varieties containing hornblende are common. See also
         the {Note} under {Mica}.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Gneissoid granite}, granite in which the mica has traces of
      a regular arrangement.

   {Graphic granite}, granite consisting of quartz and feldspar
      without mica, and having the quartz crystals so arranged
      in the transverse section like oriental characters.

   {Porphyritic granite}, granite containing feldspar in
      distinct crystals.

   {Hornblende granite}, or

   {Syenitic granite}, granite containing hornblende as well as
      mica, or, according to some authorities hornblende
      replacing the mica.

   {Granite ware}.
   (a) A kind of stoneware.
   (b) A Kind of ironware, coated with an enamel resembling
       granite.

      <WordDefinition>Syenite \Sy"e*nite\, n. [L. Syenites (sc. lapis), from Syene,
   Gr. ?.] (Min.)
   (a) Orig., a rock composed of quartz, hornblende, and
       feldspar, anciently quarried at Syene, in Upper Egypt,
       and now called {granite}.
   (b) A granular, crystalline, ingeous rock composed of
       orthoclase and hornblende, the latter often replaced or
       accompanied by pyroxene or mica. Syenite sometimes
       contains nephelite (el[ae]olite) or leucite, and is then
       called {nephelite (el[ae]olite) syenite} or {leucite
       syenite}.
