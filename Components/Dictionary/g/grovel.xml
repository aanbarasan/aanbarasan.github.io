      <WordDefinition>grovel
     
        1. To work interminably and without apparent progress.  Often
        used transitively with "over" or "through".  "The file
        scavenger has been groveling through the /usr directories for
        10 minutes now."  Compare {grind} and {crunch}.  Emphatic
        form: "grovel obscenely".
     
        2. To examine minutely or in complete detail.  "The compiler
        grovels over the entire source program before beginning to
        translate it."  "I grovelled through all the documentation,
        but I still couldn't find the command I wanted."
