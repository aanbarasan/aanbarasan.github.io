   Introduction Indonesia
   ----------------------
                            Background: The world's largest archipelago,
                                        Indonesia achieved independence from
                                        the Netherlands in 1949. Current
                                        issues include: implementing IMF-
                                        mandated reforms of the banking
                                        sector, effecting a transition to a
                                        popularly-elected government after
                                        four decades of authoritarianism,
                                        addressing charges of cronyism and
                                        corruption, holding the military
                                        accountable for human rights
                                        violations, and resolving growing
                                        separatist pressures in Aceh and
                                        Irian Jaya. On 30 August 1999 a
                                        provincial referendum for
                                        independence was overwhelmingly
                                        approved by the people of Timor
                                        Timur. Concurrence followed by
                                        Indonesia's national legislature,
                                        and the name East Timor was
                                        provisionally adopted. On 20 May
                                        2002, East Timor was internationally
                                        recognized as an independent state.

                                        faces severe economic development
                                        problems, stemming from secessionist
                                        movements and the low level of
                                        security in the regions, the lack of
                                        reliable legal recourse in contract
                                        disputes, corruption, weaknesses in
                                        the banking system, and strained
                                        relations with the IMF. Investor
                                        confidence will remain low and few
                                        new jobs will be created under these
                                        circumstances. In November 2001,
                                        Indonesia agreed with the IMF on a
                                        series of economic reforms in 2002,
                                        thus enabling further IMF
                                        disbursements. Keys to future growth
                                        remain internal reform, the build-up
                                        of the confidence of international
                                        donors and investors, and a strong
