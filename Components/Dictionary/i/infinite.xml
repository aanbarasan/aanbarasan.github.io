      <WordDefinition>infinite
     
        &lt;mathematics&gt; 1. Bigger than any {natural number}.  There are
        various formal set definitions in {set theory}: a set X is
        infinite if
     
        (i) There is a bijection between X and a proper subset of X.
     
        (ii) There is an injection from the set N of natural numbers
        to X.
     
        (iii) There is an injection from each natural number n to X.
     
        These definitions are not necessarily equivalent unless we
        accept the {Axiom of Choice}.
     
        2. The length of a line extended indefinitely.
     
        See also {infinite loop}, {infinite set}.

      [1913 Webster]

            Whatever is finite, as finite, will admit of no
            comparative relation with infinity; for whatever is
            less than infinite is still infinitely distant from
            infinity; and lower than infinite distance the
            lowest or least can not sink.         --H. Brooke.

      gigantic; prodigious.

            the thunders roll down the horizon, will the serene
            light of God flow upon us, and the blue infinite
            embrace us again.                     --J.

      <WordDefinition>infinite adj. [common] Consisting of a large number of objects;
   extreme. Used very loosely as in: "This program produces infinite
   garbage." "He is an infinite loser." The word most likely to follow
   `infinite', though, is {hair}. (It has been pointed out that fractals
   are an excellent example of infinite hair.) These uses are abuses of the
   word's mathematical meaning. The term `semi-infinite', denoting an
   immoderately large amount of some resource, is also heard. "This
   compiler is taking a semi-infinite amount of time to optimize my
   program." See also {semi}.
