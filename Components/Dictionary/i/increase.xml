          boundaries. Increase denotes enlargement by growth and
          internal vitality, as in the case of plants. A kingdom
          is enlarged by the addition of new territories; the
          mind is enlarged by knowledge. A kingdom is extended

          etc., are increased by accessions which are made from
          time to time.
