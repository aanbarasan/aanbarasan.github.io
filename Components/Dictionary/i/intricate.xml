      <WordDefinition>Intricate \In"tri*cate\, a. [L. intricatus, p. p. of intricare
   to entangle, perplex. Cf. {Intrigue}, {Extricate}.]
   Entangled; involved; perplexed; complicated; difficult to
   understand, follow, arrange, or adjust; as, intricate
   machinery, labyrinths, accounts, plots, etc.
   [1913 Webster]

         His style was fit to convey the most intricate business
         to the understanding with the utmost clearness.
                                                  --Addison.
   [1913 Webster]

         The nature of man is intricate.          --Burke.

   Syn: {Intricate}, {Complex}, {Complicated}.

   Usage: A thing is complex when it is made up of parts; it is
          complicated when those parts are so many, or so
          arranged, as to make it difficult to grasp them; it is
          intricate when it has numerous windings and confused
          involutions which it is hard to follow out. What is
          complex must be resolved into its parts; what is
          complicated must be drawn out and developed; what is
          intricate must be unraveled.
