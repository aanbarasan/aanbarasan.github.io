      <WordDefinition>iteration
     
        &lt;programming&gt; Repetition of a sequence of instructions.  A
        fundamental part of many {algorithms}.  Iteration is
        characterised by a set of initial conditions, an iterative
        step and a termination condition.
     
        A well known example of iteration in mathematics is
        Newton-Raphson iteration.  Iteration in programs is expressed
        using {loops}, e.g. in {C}:
     
        	new_x = n/2;
        	do
        	{
        	  x = new_x;
        	  new_x = 0.5 * (x + n/x);
        	} while (abs(new_x-x) &gt; epsilon);
     
        Iteration can be expressed in functional languages using
        recursion:
     
        	solve x n = if abs(new_x-x) &gt; epsilon
        		    then solve new_x n
        		    else new_x
        		    where new_x = 0.5 * (x + n/x)
     
                solve n/2 n

      <WordDefinition>Iteration \It`er*a"tion\, n. [L. iteratio.]
   1. Recital or performance a second time; repetition. --Bacon.
      [1913 Webster]

            What needs this iteration, woman?     --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Computers) The execution of a statement or series of
      statements in a loop which is repeated in a computer
      program; as, at each iteration, the counter is incremented
      by 2.

      <WordDefinition>iteration
     n 1: (computer science) a single execution of a set of
          instructions that are to be repeated; "the solution took
          hundreds of iterations" [syn: {loop}]
     2: (computer science) executing the same set of instructions a
        given number of times or until a specified result is
        obtained; "the solution is obtained by iteration" [syn: {looping}]
     3: doing or saying again; a repeated performance
