      <WordDefinition>interrupt
     
        &lt;programming&gt; 1. An {asynchronous} event that suspends normal
        processing and temporarily diverts the {flow of control}
        through an "{interrupt handler}" routine.
     
        Interrupts may be caused by both {hardware} (I/O, timer,
        machine check) and {software} (supervisor, {system call} or
        {trap} instruction).
     
        In general the computer responds to an interrupt by storing
        the information about the current state of the running
        program; storing information to identify the source of the
        interrupt; and invoking a first-level {interrupt handler}.
        This is usually a {kernel} level privileged process that can
        discover the precise cause of the interrupt (e.g. if several
        devices share one interrupt) and what must be done to keep
        operating system tables (such as the process table) updated.
        This first-level handler may then call another handler,
        e.g. one associated with the particular device which generated
        the interrupt.
     
        2. Under {MS-DOS}, nearly synonymous with "{system call}"
        because the {OS} and {BIOS} routines are both called using the
        INT instruction (see {interrupt list}) and because programmers
        so often have to bypass the operating system (going directly
        to a BIOS interrupt) to get reasonable performance.

      <WordDefinition>interrupt 1. [techspeak] n. On a computer, an event that interrupts
   normal processing and temporarily diverts flow-of-control through an
   "interrupt handler" routine. See also {trap}. 2. interj. A request for
   attention from a hacker. Often explicitly spoken. "Interrupt -- have you
   seen Joe recently?" See {priority interrupt}. 3. Under MS-DOS, nearly
   synonymous with `system call', because the OS and BIOS routines are both
   called using the INT instruction (see {{interrupt list}}) and because
   programmers so often have to bypass the OS (going directly to a BIOS
   interrupt) to get reasonable performance.
