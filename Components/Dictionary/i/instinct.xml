      <WordDefinition>Instinct \In"stinct\ ([i^]n"st[i^][ng]kt), n. [L. instinctus
   instigation, impulse, fr. instinguere to instigate: cf. F.
   instinct. See {Instinct}, a.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. Natural inward impulse; unconscious, involuntary, or
      unreasoning prompting to any mode of action, whether
      bodily, or mental, without a distinct apprehension of the
      end or object to be accomplished.
      [1913 Webster]

            An instinct is a propensity prior to experience, and
            independent of instructions.          --Paley.
      [1913 Webster]

            An instinct is a blind tendency to some mode of
            action, independent of any consideration, on the
            part of the agent, of the end to which the action
            leads.                                --Whately.
      [1913 Webster]

            An instinct is an agent which performs blindly and
            ignorantly a work of intelligence and knowledge.
                                                  --Sir W.
                                                  Hamilton.
      [1913 Webster]

            By a divine instinct, men's minds mistrust
            Ensuing dangers.                      --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Zo["o]l.) Specif., the natural, unreasoning, impulse by
      which an animal is guided to the performance of any
      action, without thought of improvement in the method.
      [1913 Webster]

            The resemblance between what originally was a habit,
            and an instinct becomes so close as not to be
            distinguished.                        --Darwin.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. A natural aptitude or knack; a predilection; as, an
      instinct for order; to be modest by instinct.
