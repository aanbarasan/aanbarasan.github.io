   {International law}, the rules regulating the mutual
      intercourse of nations. International law is mainly the
      product of the conditions from time to time of
      international intercourse, being drawn from diplomatic
      discussion, textbooks, proof of usage, and from recitals
      in treaties. It is called public when treating of the
      relations of sovereign powers, and private when of the
      relations of persons of different nationalities.
      International law is now, by the better opinion, part of
      the common law of the land. Cf. Conflict of laws, under
      {Conflict}. --Wharton.
