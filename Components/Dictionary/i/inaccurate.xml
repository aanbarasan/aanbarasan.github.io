      <WordDefinition>Inaccurate \In*ac"cu*rate\, a.
   Not accurate; not according to truth; inexact; not quite
   correct; incorrect; erroneous; as, in inaccurate man,
   narration, copy, judgment, calculation, etc.

   Note: The term inaccurate is usually used when an assertion
         or result is near to the truth, but not exactly, or has
         some basis for belief; however, it is sometimes used as
         a gentle euphemism for wrong even if the error is
         flagrant.
         [1913 Webster +PJC]

               The expression is plainly inaccurate. --Bp. Hurd.

   Syn: Inexact; incorrect; erroneous; faulty; imperfect;
        incomplete; defective.
        [1913 Webster]
