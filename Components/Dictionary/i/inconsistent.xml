      <WordDefinition>Inconsistent \In`con*sist"ent\, a. [Pref. in- not + consistent:
   cf. F. inconsistant.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. Not consistent; showing inconsistency; irreconcilable;
      contradictory, or having contradictory implications;
      discordant; at variance, esp. as regards character,
      sentiment, or action; incompatible; incongruous.
      [1913 Webster]

            Compositions of this nature . . . show that wisdom
            and virtue are far from being inconsistent with
            politeness and good humor.            --Addison.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Not exhibiting uniformity of sentiment, steadiness to
      principle, etc.; unequal; fickle; changeable.
      [1913 Webster]

            Ah, how unjust to nature, and himself,
            Is thoughtless, thankless, inconsistent man.
                                                  --Young.

   Syn: Incompatible; incongruous; irreconcilable; discordant;
        repugnant; contradictory.

   Usage: {Inconsistent}, {Incongruous}, {Incompatible}. Things
          are incongruous when they are not suited to each
          other, so that their union is unbecoming; inconsistent
          when they are opposed to each other, so as render it
          improper or wrong; incompatible when they can not
          coexist, and it is therefore impossible to unite them.
          Habitual levity of mind is incongruous with the
          profession of a clergyman; it is inconsistent with his
          ordination vows; it is incompatible with his permanent
          usefulness. Incongruity attaches to the modes and
          qualities of things; incompatibility attaches to their
          essential attributes; inconsistency attaches to the
          actions, sentiments, etc., of men.
          [1913 Webster]
