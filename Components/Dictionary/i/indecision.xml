      <WordDefinition>INDECISION, n.  The chief element of success; "for whereas," saith Sir
Thomas Brewbold, "there is but one way to do nothing and divers way to
do something, whereof, to a surety, only one is the right way, it
followeth that he who from indecision standeth still hath not so many
chances of going astray as he who pusheth forwards" -- a most clear
and satisfactory exposition on the matter.
    "Your prompt decision to attack," said Genera Grant on a certain
occasion to General Gordon Granger, "was admirable; you had but five
minutes to make up your mind in."
    "Yes, sir," answered the victorious subordinate, "it is a great
thing to be know exactly what to do in an emergency.  When in doubt
whether to attack or retreat I never hesitate a moment -- I toss us a
copper."
    "Do you mean to say that's what you did this time?"
    "Yes, General; but for Heaven's sake don't reprimand me:  I
disobeyed the coin."

      <WordDefinition>Indecision \In`de*ci"sion\, n. [Pref. in- not + decision: cf. F.
   ind['e]cision.]
   Lack of decision; lack of settled purpose, or of firmness;
   indetermination; wavering of mind; irresolution; vacillation;
   hesitation.
   [1913 Webster]

         The term indecision . . . implies an idea very nicely
         different from irresolution; yet it has a tendency to
         produce it.                              --Shenstone.
   [1913 Webster]

         Indecision . . . is the natural accomplice of violence.
                                                  --Burke.
   [1913 Webster]
