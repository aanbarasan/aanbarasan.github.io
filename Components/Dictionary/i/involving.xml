      <WordDefinition>Involve \In*volve"\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Involved}; p. pr. &amp;
   vb. n. {Involving}.] [L. involvere, involutum, to roll about,
   wrap up; pref. in- in + volvere to roll: cf. OF. involver.
   See {Voluble}, and cf. {Involute}.]

      [1913 Webster]

            His end with mine involved.           --Milton.

      ``Involved in a deep study.'' --Sir W. Scott.
      [1913 Webster]

   8. (Math.) To raise to any assigned power; to multiply, as a
      quantity, into itself a given number of times; as, a
      quantity involved to the third or fourth power.

   Syn: To imply; include; implicate; complicate; entangle;
        embarrass; overwhelm.

   Usage: To {Involve}, {Imply}. Imply is opposed to express, or
          set forth; thus, an implied engagement is one fairly
          to be understood from the words used or the
          circumstances of the case, though not set forth in
          form. Involve goes beyond the mere interpretation of
          things into their necessary relations; and hence, if
          one thing involves another, it so contains it that the
          two must go together by an indissoluble connection.
          War, for example, involves wide spread misery and
          death; the premises of a syllogism involve the
          conclusion.
          [1913 Webster]
