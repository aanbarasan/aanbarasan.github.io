      <WordDefinition>inverse
     
        &lt;mathematics&gt; Given a {function}, f : D -&gt; C, a function g : C
        -&gt; D is called a left inverse for f if for all d in D, g (f d)
        = d and a right inverse if, for all c in C, f (g c) = c and an
        inverse if both conditions hold.  Only an {injection} has a
        left inverse, only a {surjection} has a right inverse and only
        a {bijection} has inverses.  The inverse of f is often written
        as f with a -1 superscript.

      <WordDefinition>Inverse \In*verse"\, a. [L. inversus, p. p. of invertere: cf. F.
   inverse. See {Invert}.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. Opposite in order, relation, or effect; reversed;
      inverted; reciprocal; -- opposed to {direct}.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Bot.) Inverted; having a position or mode of attachment
      the reverse of that which is usual.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. (Math.) Opposite in nature and effect; -- said with
      reference to any two operations, which, when both are
      performed in succession upon any quantity, reproduce that
      quantity; as, multiplication is the inverse operation to
      division. The symbol of an inverse operation is the symbol
      of the direct operation with -1 as an index. Thus sin-1 x
      means the arc or angle whose sine is x.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Inverse figures} (Geom.), two figures, such that each point
      of either figure is inverse to a corresponding point in
      the order figure.

   {Inverse points} (Geom.), two points lying on a line drawn
      from the center of a fixed circle or sphere, and so
      related that the product of their distances from the
      center of the circle or sphere is equal to the square of
      the radius.

   {Inverse ratio}, or {Reciprocal ratio} (Math.), the ratio of
      the reciprocals of two quantities.

   {Inverse proportion}, or {Reciprocal proportion}, an equality
      between a direct ratio and a reciprocal ratio; thus, 4 : 2
      : : 1/3 : 1/6, or 4 : 2 : : 3 : 6, inversely.
