      <WordDefinition>Infant \In"fant\, n. [L. infans; pref. in- not + fari to speak:
   cf. F. enfant, whence OE. enfaunt. See {Fame}, and cf.
   {Infante}, {Infanta}.]
   1. A child in the first period of life, beginning at his
      birth; a young babe; sometimes, a child several years of
      age.
      [1913 Webster]

            And tender cries of infants pierce the ear. --C.
                                                  Pitt.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Law) A person who is not of full age, or who has not
      attained the age of legal capacity; a person under the age
      of twenty-one years; a minor.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: An infant under seven years of age is not penally
         responsible; between seven and fourteen years of age,
         he may be convicted of a malicious offense if malice be
         proved. He becomes of age on the day preceding his
         twenty-first birthday, previous to which time an infant
         has no capacity to contract.
         [1913 Webster]

   3. Same as {Infante}. [Obs.] --Spenser.
      [1913 Webster]
