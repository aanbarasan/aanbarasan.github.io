      <WordDefinition>infinity
     
        1. &lt;mathematics&gt; The size of something {infinite}.
     
        Using the word in the context of sets is sloppy, since
        different {infinite set}s aren't necessarily the same size
        {cardinality} as each other.
     
        See also {aleph 0}
     
        2. &lt;programming&gt; The largest value that can be represented in
        a particular type of variable ({register}, memory location,
        data type, whatever).
     
        See also {minus infinity}.

      <WordDefinition>Infinity \In*fin"i*ty\, n.; pl. {Infinities}. [L. infinitas;
   pref. in- not + finis boundary, limit, end: cf. F.
   infinit['e]. See {Finite}.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. Unlimited extent of time, space, or quantity; eternity;
      boundlessness; immensity. --Sir T. More.
      [1913 Webster]

            There can not be more infinities than one; for one
            of them would limit the other.        --Sir W.
                                                  Raleigh.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Unlimited capacity, energy, excellence, or knowledge; as,
      the infinity of God and his perfections. --Hooker.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Endless or indefinite number; great multitude; as an
      infinity of beauties. --Broome.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. (Math.) A quantity greater than any assignable quantity of
      the same kind.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Mathematically considered, infinity is always a limit
         of a variable quantity, resulting from a particular
         supposition made upon the varying element which enters
         it. --Davies &amp; Peck (Math. Dict.).
         [1913 Webster]

   5. (Geom.) That part of a line, or of a plane, or of space,
      which is infinitely distant. In modern geometry, parallel
      lines or planes are sometimes treated as lines or planes
      meeting at infinity.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Circle at infinity}, an imaginary circle at infinity,
      through which, in geometry of three dimensions, every
      sphere is imagined to pass.

   {Circular points at infinity}. See under {Circular}.
      [1913 Webster]

      <WordDefinition>infinity n. 1. The largest value that can be represented in a
   particular type of variable (register, memory location, data type,
   whatever). 2. `minus infinity': The smallest such value, not necessarily
   or even usually the simple negation of plus infinity. In N-bit
   twos-complement arithmetic, infinity is 2^(N-1) - 1 but minus infinity
   is - (2^(N-1)), not -(2^(N-1) - 1). Note also that this is different
   from "time T equals minus infinity", which is closer to a
   mathematician's usage of infinity.
