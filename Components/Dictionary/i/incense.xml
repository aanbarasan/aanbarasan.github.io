      <WordDefinition>Incense
   a fragrant composition prepared by the "art of the apothecary."
   It consisted of four ingredients "beaten small" (Ex. 30:34-36).
   That which was not thus prepared was called "strange incense"
   (30:9). It was offered along with every meat-offering; and
   besides was daily offered on the golden altar in the holy place,
   and on the great day of atonement was burnt by the high priest
   in the holy of holies (30:7, 8). It was the symbol of prayer
   (Ps. 141:1,2; Rev. 5:8; 8:3, 4).
