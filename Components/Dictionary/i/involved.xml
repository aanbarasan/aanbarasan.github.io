      <WordDefinition>Involve \In*volve"\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Involved}; p. pr. &amp;
   vb. n. {Involving}.] [L. involvere, involutum, to roll about,
   wrap up; pref. in- in + volvere to roll: cf. OF. involver.
   See {Voluble}, and cf. {Involute}.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. To roll or fold up; to wind round; to entwine.
      [1913 Webster]

            Some of serpent kind . . . involved
            Their snaky folds.                    --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. To envelop completely; to surround; to cover; to hide; to
      involve in darkness or obscurity.
      [1913 Webster]

            And leave a sing[`e]d bottom all involved
            With stench and smoke.                --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. To complicate or make intricate, as in grammatical
      structure. ``Involved discourses.'' --Locke.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. To connect with something as a natural or logical
      consequence or effect; to include necessarily; to imply.
      [1913 Webster]

            He knows
            His end with mine involved.           --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

            The contrary necessarily involves a contradiction.
                                                  --Tillotson.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. To take in; to gather in; to mingle confusedly; to blend

      [1913 Webster]

            Involves a vast involuntary throng.   --Pope.

            To mingle and involve.                --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   6. To envelop, infold, entangle, or embarrass; as, to involve
      a person in debt or misery.
      [1913 Webster]

   7. To engage thoroughly; to occupy, employ, or absorb.
      ``Involved in a deep study.'' --Sir W. Scott.
      [1913 Webster]

   8. (Math.) To raise to any assigned power; to multiply, as a
      quantity, into itself a given number of times; as, a
      quantity involved to the third or fourth power.

   Syn: To imply; include; implicate; complicate; entangle;
        embarrass; overwhelm.

   Usage: To {Involve}, {Imply}. Imply is opposed to express, or
          set forth; thus, an implied engagement is one fairly
          to be understood from the words used or the
          circumstances of the case, though not set forth in
          form. Involve goes beyond the mere interpretation of
          things into their necessary relations; and hence, if
          one thing involves another, it so contains it that the
          two must go together by an indissoluble connection.
          War, for example, involves wide spread misery and
          death; the premises of a syllogism involve the
          conclusion.
          [1913 Webster]
