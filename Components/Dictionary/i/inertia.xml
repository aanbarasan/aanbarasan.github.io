   {Inert}.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. (Physics) That property of matter by which it tends when
      at rest to remain so, and when in motion to continue in
      motion, and in the same straight line or direction, unless
      acted on by some external force; -- sometimes called {vis
      inerti[ae]}. The inertia of a body is proportional to its
      mass.
      [1913 Webster +PJC]

   2. Inertness; indisposition to motion, exertion, or action;
      lack of energy; sluggishness.
      [1913 Webster]

            Men . . . have immense irresolution and inertia.
                                                  --Carlyle.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. (Med.) Lack of activity; sluggishness; -- said especially
      of the uterus, when, in labor, its contractions have
      nearly or wholly ceased.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Center of inertia}. (Mech.) See under {Center}.
