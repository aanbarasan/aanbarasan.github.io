      <WordDefinition>Impediment \Im*ped"i*ment\, n. [L. impedimentum: cf. F.
   impediment.]
   That which impedes or hinders progress, motion, activity, or
   effect.
   [1913 Webster]

         Thus far into the bowels of the land
         Have we marched on without impediment.   --Shak.
   [1913 Webster]

   {Impediment in speech}, a defect which prevents distinct
      utterance.

   Syn: Hindrance; obstruction; obstacle; difficulty;
        incumbrance.

   Usage: {Impediment}, {Obstacle}, {Difficulty}, {Hindrance}.
          An impediment literally strikes against our feet,
          checking our progress, and we remove it. An obstacle
          rises before us in our path, and we surmount or remove
          it. A difficulty sets before us something hard to be
          done, and we encounter it and overcome it. A hindrance
          holds us back for a time, but we break away from it.
          [1913 Webster]

                The eloquence of Demosthenes was to Philip of
                Macedon, a difficulty to be met with his best
                resources, an obstacle to his own ambition, and
                an impediment in his political career. --C. J.
                                                  Smith.
