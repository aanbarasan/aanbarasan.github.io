      <WordDefinition>image
     
        1. &lt;data, graphics&gt; Data representing a two-dimensional scene.
        A digital image is composed of {pixels} arranged in a
        rectangular array with a certain height and width.  Each pixel
        may consist of one or more {bit}s of information, representing
        the brightness of the image at that point and possibly
        including colour information encoded as {RGB} triples.
     
        {Images} are usually taken from the real world via a {digital
        camera}, {frame grabber}, or {scanner}; or they may be
        generated by computer, e.g. by {ray tracing} software.
     
        See also {image formats}, {image processing}.
     
        (1994-10-21)
     
        2. &lt;mathematics&gt; The image (or range) of a {function} is the
        set of values obtained by applying the function to all
        elements of its {domain}.  So, if f : D -&gt; C then the set f(D)
        = \{ f(d) | d in D \} is the image of D under f.  The image is
        a subset of C, the {codomain}.
