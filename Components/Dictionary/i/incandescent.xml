   pr. of incandescere to become warm or hot; pref. in- in +
   candescere to become of a glittering whiteness, to become red
   hot, incho. fr. candere to be of a glittering whiteness: cf.
   F. incandescent. See {Candle}.]

   [1913 Webster]

         Holy Scripture become resplendent; or, as one might
         say, incandescent throughout.            --I. Taylor.
   [1913 Webster]

   {Incandescent lamp}, {Incandescent light}, {Incandescent
   light bulb} (Elec.), a kind of lamp in which the light is
      produced by a thin filament of conducting material, now
      usually tungsten, but originally carbon, contained in a
      vacuum or an atmosphere of inert gas within a glass bulb,
      and heated to incandescence by an electric current. It was
      inventerd by Thomas Edison, and was once called the
      {Edison lamp}; -- called also {incandescence lamp}, and
      {glowlamp}. This is one of the two most common sources of
      electric light, the other being the {fluorescent light},
      {fluorescent lamp} or {fluorescent bulb}.
