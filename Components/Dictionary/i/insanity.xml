      <WordDefinition>Insanity \In*san"i*ty\, n. [L. insanitas unsoundness; cf.
   insania insanity, F. insanite.]
   1. The state of being insane; unsoundness or derangement of
      mind; madness; lunacy.
      [1913 Webster]

            All power of fancy over reason is a degree of
            insanity.                             --Johnson.
      [1913 Webster]

            Without grace
            The heart's insanity admits no cure.  --Cowper.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Law) Such a mental condition, as, either from the
      existence of delusions, or from incapacity to distinguish
      between right and wrong, with regard to any matter under
      action, does away with individual responsibility.

   Syn: {Insanity}, {Lunacy}, {Madness}, {Derangement},
        {Alienation}, {Aberration}, {Mania}, {Delirium},
        {Frenzy}, {Monomania}, {Dementia}.

   Usage: Insanity is the generic term for all such diseases;
          lunacy has now an equal extent of meaning, though once
          used to denote periodical insanity; madness has the
          same extent, though originally referring to the rage
          created by the disease; derangement, alienation, are
          popular terms for insanity; delirium, mania, and
          frenzy denote excited states of the disease; dementia
          denotes the loss of mental power by this means;
          monomania is insanity upon a single subject.
          [1913 Webster]
