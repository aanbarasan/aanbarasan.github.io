   implication.]
   1. The act of implicating, or the state of being implicated.
      [1913 Webster]

            Three principal causes of firmness are. the
            grossness, the quiet contact, and the implication of
            component parts.                      --Boyle.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. An implying, or that which is implied, but not expressed;
      an inference, or something which may fairly be understood,
      though not expressed in words.
      [1913 Webster]

            Whatever things, therefore, it was asserted that the
            king might do, it was a necessary implication that
            there were other things which he could not do.
                                                  --Hallam.
      [1913 Webster]
