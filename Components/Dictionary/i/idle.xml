   ijdel, OHG. [=i]tal vain, empty, mere, G. eitel, Dan. &amp; Sw.

      [1913 Webster]

   3. Not employed; unoccupied with business; inactive; doing
      nothing; as, idle workmen.

      used to transmit power.

   {Idle wheel} (Mach.), a gear wheel placed between two others,

   {In idle}, in vain. [Obs.] ``God saith, thou shalt not take
      the name of thy Lord God in idle.'' --Chaucer.

   Syn: Unoccupied; unemployed; vacant; inactive; indolent;
        sluggish; slothful; useless; ineffectual; futile;
        frivolous; vain; trifling; unprofitable; unimportant.

   Usage: {Idle}, {Indolent}, {Lazy}. A propensity to inaction
          is expressed by each of these words; they differ in
          the cause and degree of this characteristic. Indolent
          denotes an habitual love to ease, a settled dislike of
          movement or effort; idle is opposed to {busy}, and
          denotes a dislike of continuous exertion. Lazy is a
          stronger and more contemptuous term than indolent.
          [1913 Webster]
