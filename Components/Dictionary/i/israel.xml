      <WordDefinition>Israel
   the name conferred on Jacob after the great prayer-struggle at
   Peniel (Gen. 32:28), because "as a prince he had power with God
   and prevailed." (See {JACOB}.) This is the common name
   given to Jacob's descendants. The whole people of the twelve
   tribes are called "Israelites," the "children of Israel" (Josh.
   3:17; 7:25; Judg. 8:27; Jer. 3:21), and the "house of Israel"
   (Ex. 16:31; 40:38).
   
     This name Israel is sometimes used emphatically for the true
   Israel (Ps. 73:1: Isa. 45:17; 49:3; John 1:47; Rom. 9:6; 11:26).
   
     After the death of Saul the ten tribes arrogated to themselves
   this name, as if they were the whole nation (2 Sam. 2:9, 10, 17,
   28; 3:10, 17; 19:40-43), and the kings of the ten tribes were
   called "kings of Israel," while the kings of the two tribes were
   called "kings of Judah."
   
     After the Exile the name Israel was assumed as designating the
   entire nation.

   Introduction Israel
   -------------------
                            Background: Following World War II, the British
                                        withdrew from their mandate of
                                        Palestine, and the UN partitioned
                                        the area into Arab and Jewish
                                        states, an arrangement rejected by
                                        the Arabs. Subsequently, the
                                        Israelis defeated the Arabs in a
                                        series of wars without ending the
                                        deep tensions between the two sides.
                                        The territories occupied by Israel
                                        since the 1967 war are not included
                                        in the Israel country profile,
                                        unless otherwise noted. On 25 April
                                        1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai
                                        pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt
                                        Peace Treaty. Outstanding
                                        territorial and other disputes with
                                        Jordan were resolved in the 26
                                        October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of
                                        Peace. In keeping with the framework
                                        established at the Madrid Conference
                                        in October 1991, bilateral
                                        negotiations were conducted between
                                        Israel and Palestinian
                                        representatives (from the Israeli-
                                        occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip)
                                        and Syria, to achieve a permanent
                                        settlement; however, these efforts
                                        were derailed/postponed by the
                                        outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian
                                        violence in September 2000. On 25
                                        May 2000, Israel withdrew
                                        unilaterally from southern Lebanon,
                                        which it had occupied since 1982.

   Economy Israel
   --------------
                    Economy - overview: Israel has a technologically
                                        advanced market economy with
                                        substantial government
                                        participation. It depends on imports
                                        of crude oil, grains, raw materials,
                                        and military equipment. Despite
                                        limited natural resources, Israel
                                        has intensively developed its
                                        agricultural and industrial sectors
                                        over the past 20 years. Israel is
                                        largely self-sufficient in food
                                        production except for grains. Cut
                                        diamonds, high-technology equipment,
                                        and agricultural products (fruits
                                        and vegetables) are the leading
                                        exports. Israel usually posts
                                        sizable current account deficits,
                                        which are covered by large transfer
                                        payments from abroad and by foreign
                                        loans. Roughly half of the
                                        government's external debt is owed
                                        to the US, which is its major source
                                        of economic and military aid. The
                                        influx of Jewish immigrants from the
                                        former USSR during the period 1989-
                                        99 coupled with the opening of new
                                        markets at the end of the Cold War,
                                        energized Israel's economy, which
                                        grew rapidly in the early 1990s. But
                                        growth began moderating in 1996 when
                                        the government imposed tighter
                                        fiscal and monetary policies and the
                                        immigration bonus petered out.
                                        Growth was a strong 6.4% in 2000.
                                        But the outbreak of Palestinian
                                        unrest in late September 2000 and
                                        the declines in the high-technology
                                        and tourist sectors led to a 0.6%
