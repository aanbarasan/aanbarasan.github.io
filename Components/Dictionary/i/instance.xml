      <WordDefinition>instance
     
        &lt;programming&gt; An individual {object} of a certain {class}.
        While a class is just the type definition, an actual usage of
        a class is called "instance".  Each instance of a class can
        have different values for its {instance variables}, i.e. its
        {state}.
