   Syn: To enlarge; extend; multiply; expand; develop; heighten;
        amplify; raise; enhance; spread; aggravate; magnify;
        augment; advance.

   Usage: To {Increase}, {Enlarge}, {Extend}. Enlarge implies to
          make larger or broader in size. Extend marks the
          progress of enlargement so as to have wider
          boundaries. Increase denotes enlargement by growth and
          internal vitality, as in the case of plants. A kingdom
          is enlarged by the addition of new territories; the
          mind is enlarged by knowledge. A kingdom is extended
          when its boundaries are carried to a greater distance
          from the center. A man's riches, honors, knowledge,
          etc., are increased by accessions which are made from
          time to time.
