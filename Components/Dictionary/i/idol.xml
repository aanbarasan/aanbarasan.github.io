      <WordDefinition>Idol
   (1.) Heb. aven, "nothingness;" "vanity" (Isa. 66:3; 41:29; Deut.
   32:21; 1 Kings 16:13; Ps. 31:6; Jer. 8:19, etc.).
   
     (2.) 'Elil, "a thing of naught" (Ps. 97:7; Isa. 19:3); a word
   of contempt, used of the gods of Noph (Ezek. 30:13).
   
     (3.) 'Emah, "terror," in allusion to the hideous form of idols
   (Jer. 50:38).
   
     (4.) Miphletzeth, "a fright;" "horror" (1 Kings 15:13; 2 Chr.
   15:16).

     (9.) Tselem, "a shadow" (Dan. 3:1; 1 Sam. 6:5), as
   distinguished from the "likeness," or the exact counterpart.
   
     (10.) Temunah, "similitude" (Deut. 4:12-19). Here Moses
   forbids the several forms of Gentile idolatry.
   
     (11.) 'Atsab, "a figure;" from the root "to fashion," "to
   labour;" denoting that idols are the result of man's labour
   (Isa. 48:5; Ps. 139:24, "wicked way;" literally, as some
   translate, "way of an idol").

   given to the statues of Baal (2 Kings 3:2; 10:27).
   
     (14.) Hammanim, "sun-images." Hamman is a synonym of Baal, the
   sun-god of the Phoenicians (2 Chr. 34:4, 7; 14:3, 5; Isa. 17:8).
   
     (15.) Maskith, "device" (Lev. 26:1; Num. 33:52). In Lev. 26:1,
   the words "image of stone" (A.V.) denote "a stone or cippus with
   the image of an idol, as Baal, Astarte, etc." In Ezek. 8:12,
   "chambers of imagery" (maskith), are "chambers of which the
   walls are painted with the figures of idols;" comp. ver. 10, 11.
   
     (16.) Pesel, "a graven" or "carved image" (Isa. 44:10-20). It
   denotes also a figure cast in metal (Deut. 7:25; 27:15; Isa.
   40:19; 44:10).
   
     (17.) Massekah, "a molten image" (Deut. 9:12; Judg. 17:3, 4).

   David's bed (Judg. 17:5; 18:14, 17, 18, 20; 1 Sam. 19:13).
   
     "Nothing can be more instructive and significant than this
   multiplicity and variety of words designating the instruments
   and inventions of idolatry."
