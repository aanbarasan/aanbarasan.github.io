      <WordDefinition>infrared
     
        &lt;electronics&gt; (IR) Electromagnetic waves in the frequency
        range just below visible light corresponding to radiated heat.
        IR waves can be generated by a kind of {LED} and are often
        used for remote controls for televisions etc. and in some
        {docking stations}.

      <WordDefinition>Infrared \In`fra*red"\, Infra-red \In`fra-red"\, a. [Infra- +
   red.]
   1. (Physics) Lying outside the visible spectrum at its red
      end; -- said of rays having a longer wavelength (and thus
      less refrangible) than the extreme red rays, specifically
      those electromagnetic waves having a wavelength of between
      700 nanometers and 1 millimeter.
      [Webster 1913 Suppl. +PJC]

   2. relating to, using, or producing infrared radiation.
      [PJC]

   3. affected by infrared radiation; as, infrared detector;
      infrared film.

      <WordDefinition>infrared
     adj : having or employing wavelengths longer than light but
           shorter than radio waves; lying outside the visible
           spectrum at its red end; "infrared radiation";
           "infrared photography"
     n 1: the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum;
          electromagnetic wave frequencies below the visible
          range; "they could sense radiation in the infrared"
          [syn: {infrared frequency}]
     2: electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths longer than
        visible light but shorter than radio waves [syn: {infrared
        light}, {infrared radiation}, {infrared emission}]
