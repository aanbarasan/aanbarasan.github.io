   occurs only in Esther 1:1 and 8:9, where the extent of the
   dominion of the Persian king is described. The country so
   designated here is not the peninsula of Hindustan, but the
   country surrounding the Indus, the Punjab. The people and the
   products of India were well known to the Jews, who seem to have
   carried on an active trade with that country (Ezek. 27:15, 24).

   Introduction India
   ------------------
                            Background: The Indus Valley civilization, one
                                        of the oldest in the world, goes
                                        back at least 5,000 years. Aryan
                                        tribes from the northwest invaded
                                        about 1500 B.C.; their merger with
                                        the earlier inhabitants created the
                                        classical Indian culture. Arab
                                        incursions starting in the 8th
                                        century and Turkish in 12th were
                                        followed by European traders
                                        beginning in the late 15th century.
                                        By the 19th century, Britain had
                                        assumed political control of
                                        virtually all Indian lands.
                                        Nonviolent resistance to British
                                        colonialism under Mohandas GANDHI
                                        and Jawaharlal NEHRU led to
                                        independence in 1947. The
                                        subcontinent was divided into the
                                        secular state of India and the
                                        smaller Muslim state of Pakistan. A
                                        third war between the two countries
                                        in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan
                                        becoming the separate nation of
                                        Bangladesh. Fundamental concerns in
                                        India include the ongoing dispute
                                        with Pakistan over Kashmir, massive
                                        overpopulation, environmental
                                        degradation, extensive poverty, and
                                        ethnic and religious strife, all
                                        this despite impressive gains in
                                        economic investment and output.
