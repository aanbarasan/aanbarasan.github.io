        1. Ideal DEductive Applicative Language.  A language by Pier
        Bosco and Elio Giovannetti combining {Miranda} and {Prolog}.
        Function definitions can have a {guard} condition (introduced
        by ":-") which is a conjunction of equalities between
        arbitrary terms, including functions.  These guards are solved
        by normal {Prolog} {resolution} and {unification}.  It was
        originally compiled into {C-Prolog} but was eventually to be
        compiled to {K-leaf}.
     
        2. A numerical {constraint} language written by Van Wyk of
        {Stanford} in 1980 for {typesetting} graphics in documents.
        It was inspired partly by {Metafont} and is distributed as
        part of {Troff}.

      <WordDefinition>ideal
     
        &lt;theory&gt; In {domain theory}, a non-empty, {downward closed}
        subset which is also closed under binary {least upper bounds}.
        I.e. anything less than an element is also an element and the
        least upper bound of any two elements is also an element.

      <WordDefinition>Ideal \I*de"al\, n.
   A mental conception regarded as a standard of perfection; a
   model of excellence, beauty, etc.
   [1913 Webster]

         The ideal is to be attained by selecting and assembling
         in one whole the beauties and perfections which are
         usually seen in different individuals, excluding
         everything defective or unseemly, so as to form a type
         or model of the species. Thus, the Apollo Belvedere is
         the ideal of the beauty and proportion of the human
         frame.                                   --Fleming.
   [1913 Webster]

   {Beau ideal}. See {Beau ideal}.
