      <WordDefinition>Inference \In"fer*ence\, n. [From {Infer}.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. The act or process of inferring by deduction or induction.
      [1913 Webster]

            Though it may chance to be right in the conclusions,
            it is yet unjust and mistaken in the method of
            inference.                            --Glanvill.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. That which inferred; a truth or proposition drawn from
      another which is admitted or supposed to be true; a
      conclusion; a deduction. --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

            These inferences, or conclusions, are the effects of
            reasoning, and the three propositions, taken all
            together, are called syllogism, or argument. --I.
                                                  Watts.

   Syn: Conclusion; deduction; consequence.

   Usage: {Inference}, {Conclusion}. An inference is literally
          that which is brought in; and hence, a deduction or
          induction from premises, -- something which follows as
          certainly or probably true. A conclusion is stronger
          than an inference; it shuts us up to the result, and
          terminates inquiry. We infer what is particular or
          probable; we conclude what is certain. In a chain of
          reasoning we have many inferences, which lead to the
          ultimate conclusion. ``An inference is a proposition
          which is perceived to be true, because of its
          connection with some known fact.'' ``When something is
          simply affirmed to be true, it is called a
          proposition; after it has been found to be true by
          several reasons or arguments, it is called a
          conclusion.'' --I. Taylor.
          [1913 Webster]

      <WordDefinition>inference
     n : the reasoning involved in drawing a conclusion or making a
         logical judgment on the basis of circumstantial evidence
         and prior conclusions rather than on the basis of direct
