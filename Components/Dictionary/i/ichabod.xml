      <WordDefinition>Ichabod
   When the tidings of the disastrous defeat of the Israelites in
   the battle against the Philistines near to Mizpeh were carried
   to Shiloh, the wife of Phinehas "was near to be delivered. And
   when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and
   that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed
   herself and travailed" (1 Sam. 4:19-22). In her great distress
   she regarded not "the women that stood by her," but named the
   child that was born "Ichabod" i.e., no glory, saying, "The glory
   is departed from Isreal;" and with that word on her lips she
   expired.
