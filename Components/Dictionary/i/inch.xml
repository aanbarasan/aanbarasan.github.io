      <WordDefinition>Inch \Inch\, n. [OE. inche, unche, AS. ynce, L. uncia the
   twelfth part, inch, ounce. See {Ounce} a weight.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. A measure of length, the twelfth part of a foot, commonly
      subdivided into halves, quarters, eights, sixteenths,
      etc., as among mechanics. It was also formerly divided
      into twelve parts, called lines, and originally into three
      parts, called barleycorns, its length supposed to have
      been determined from three grains of barley placed end to
      end lengthwise. It is also sometimes called a prime ('),
      composed of twelve seconds (''), as in the duodecimal
      system of arithmetic.
      [1913 Webster]

            12 seconds ('') make 1 inch or prime. 12 inches or
            primes (') make 1 foot.               --B.
                                                  Greenleaf.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The meter, the accepted scientific standard of length,
         equals 39.37 inches; the inch is equal to 2.54
         centimeters. See {Metric system}, and {Meter}.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. A small distance or degree, whether of time or space;
      hence, a critical moment; also used metaphorically of
      minor concessins in bargaining; as, he won't give an inch;
      give him an inch and he'll take a mile.
      [1913 Webster]

            Beldame, I think we watched you at an inch. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   {By inches}, by slow degrees, gradually.
