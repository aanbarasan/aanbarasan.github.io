        1. Incompatible {time-sharing} System
     
        An influential but highly idiosyncratic {operating system}
        written for the {PDP-6} and {PDP-10} at {MIT} and long used at
        the {MIT AI Lab}.  Much AI-hacker jargon derives from ITS
        folklore, and to have been "an ITS hacker" qualifies one
        instantly as an old-timer of the most venerable sort.  ITS
        pioneered many important innovations, including transparent
        file sharing between machines and terminal-independent I/O.
        After about 1982, most actual work was shifted to newer
        machines, with the remaining ITS boxes run essentially as a
        hobby and service to the hacker community.  The shutdown of
        the lab's last ITS machine in May 1990 marked the end of an
        era and sent old-time hackers into mourning nationwide (see
        {high moby}).  The Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden is
        maintaining one "live" ITS site at its computer museum (right
        next to the only {TOPS-10} system still on the {Internet}), so
        ITS is still alleged to hold the record for OS in longest
        continuous use (however, {WAITS} is a credible rival for this
        palm).
     
        2. A mythical image of {operating system} perfection worshiped
        by a bizarre, fervent retro-cult of old-time hackers and
        ex-users (see {troglodyte}).  ITS worshipers manage somehow to
        continue believing that an OS maintained by {assembly
        language} hand-hacking that supported only monocase
        6-character filenames in one directory per account remains
        superior to today's state of commercial art (their venom
        against {Unix} is particularly intense).

      <WordDefinition>ITS /I-T-S/ n. 1. Incompatible Time-sharing System, an influential

   derives from ITS folklore, and to have been `an ITS hacker' qualifies
   one instantly as an old-timer of the most venerable sort. ITS pioneered

   mythical image of operating-system perfection worshiped by a bizarre,
   fervent retro-cult of old-time hackers and ex-users (see {troglodyte},
   sense 2). ITS worshipers manage somehow to continue believing that an OS
