      <WordDefinition>Ample \Am"ple\, a. [F. ample, L. amplus, prob. for ambiplus full
   on both sides, the last syllable akin to L. plenus full. See
   {Full}, and cf. {Double}.]
   Large; great in size, extent, capacity, or bulk; spacious;
   roomy; widely extended.
   [1913 Webster]

         All the people in that ample house
         Did to that image bow their humble knees. --Spenser.
   [1913 Webster]

   2. Fully sufficient; abundant; liberal; copious; as, an ample
      fortune; ample justice.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Not contracted of brief; not concise; extended; diffusive;
      as, an ample narrative. --Johnson.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Full; spacious; extensive; wide; capacious; abundant;
        plentiful; plenteous; copious; bountiful; rich; liberal;
        munificent.

   Usage: {Ample}, {Copious}, {Abundant}, {Plenteous}. These
          words agree in representing a thing as large, but
          under different relations, according to the image
          which is used. Ample implies largeness, producing a
          sufficiency or fullness of supply for every want; as,
          ample stores or resources, ample provision. Copious
          carries with it the idea of flow, or of collection at
          a single point; as, a copious supply of materials.
          ``Copious matter of my song.'' --Milton. Abundant and
          plenteous refer to largeness of quantity; as, abundant
          stores; plenteous harvests.
          [1913 Webster]
