      <WordDefinition>Afraid \A*fraid"\, p. a. [OE. afrayed, affraide, p. p. of
   afraien to affray. See {Affray}, and cf. {Afeard}.]
   Impressed with fear or apprehension; in fear; apprehensive.
   [Afraid comes after the noun it limits.] ``Back they
   recoiled, afraid.'' --Milton.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: This word expresses a less degree of fear than
         terrified or frightened. It is followed by of before
         the object of fear, or by the infinitive, or by a
         dependent clause; as, to be afraid of death. ``I am
         afraid to die.'' ``I am afraid he will chastise me.''
         ``Be not afraid that I your hand should take.'' --Shak.
         I am afraid is sometimes used colloquially to soften a
         statement; as, I am afraid I can not help you in this
         matter.
         [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Fearful; timid; timorous; alarmed; anxious.
        [1913 Webster]
