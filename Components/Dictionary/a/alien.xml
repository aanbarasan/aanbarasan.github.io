      <WordDefinition>Alien
   a foreigner, or person born in another country, and therefore
   not entitled to the rights and privileges of the country where
   he resides. Among the Hebrews there were two classes of aliens.
   
     (1.) Those who were strangers generally, and who owned no
   landed property.
   
     (2.) Strangers dwelling in another country without being
   naturalized (Lev. 22:10; Ps. 39:12).
   
     Both of these classes were to enjoy, under certain conditions,
   the same rights as other citizens (Lev. 19:33, 34; Deut. 10:19).
   They might be naturalized and permitted to enter into the
   congregation of the Lord by submitting to circumcision and
   abandoning idolatry (Deut. 23:3-8).
   
     This term is used (Eph. 2:12) to denote persons who have no
   interest in Christ.
