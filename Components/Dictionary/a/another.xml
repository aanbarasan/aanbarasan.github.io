      [1913 Webster]

            Let another man praise thee, and not thine own
            mouth.                                --Prov. xxvii.
                                                  2.

      [1913 Webster]

   Note: As a pronoun another may have a possessive another's,
         pl. others, poss. pl. other'. It is much used in
         opposition to one; as, one went one way, another
         another. It is also used with one, in a reciprocal
         sense; as, ``love one another,'' that is, let each love
         the other or others. ``These two imparadised in one
         another's arms.'' --Milton.
         [1913 Webster]
