      <WordDefinition>Argue \Ar"gue\, v. t.
   1. To debate or discuss; to treat by reasoning; as, the
      counsel argued the cause before a full court; the cause
      was well argued.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. To prove or evince; too manifest or exhibit by inference,
      deduction, or reasoning.
      [1913 Webster]

            So many laws argue so many sins.      --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. To persuade by reasons; as, to argue a man into a
      different opinion.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. To blame; to accuse; to charge with. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

            Thoughts and expressions . . . which can be truly
            argued of obscenity, profaneness, or immorality.
                                                  --Dryden.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: to reason; evince; discuss; debate; expostulate;
        remonstrate; controvert.

   Usage: To {Argue}, {Dispute}, {Debate}. These words, as here
          compared, suppose a contest between two parties in
          respect to some point at issue. To argue is to adduce
          arguments or reasons in support of one's cause or
          position. To dispute is to call in question or deny
          the statements or arguments of the opposing party. To
          debate is to strive for or against in a somewhat
          formal manner by arguments.
          [1913 Webster]

                Men of many words sometimes argue for the sake
                of talking; men of ready tongues frequently
                dispute for the sake of victory; men in public
                life often debate for the sake of opposing the
                ruling party, or from any other motive than the
                love of truth.                    --Crabb.
          [1913 Webster]

                Unskilled to argue, in dispute yet loud,
                Bold without caution, without honors proud.
                                                  --Falconer.
          [1913 Webster]

                Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate.
                                                  --Dryden.
          [1913 Webster]
