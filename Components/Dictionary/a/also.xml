   3. Even as; as; so. [Obs.] --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: {Also}, {Likewise}, {Too}.

   Usage: These words are used by way of transition, in leaving
          one thought and passing to another. Also is the widest
          term. It denotes that what follows is all so, or
          entirely like that which preceded, or may be affirmed
          with the same truth; as, ``If you were there, I was
          there also;'' ``If our situation has some discomforts,
          it has also many sources of enjoyment.'' Too is simply
          less formal and pointed than also; it marks the
          transition with a lighter touch; as, ``I was there
          too;'' ``a courtier yet a patriot too.'' --Pope.
          Likewise denotes literally ``in like manner,'' and
          hence has been thought by some to be more specific
          than also. ``It implies,'' says Whately, ``some
          connection or agreement between the words it unites.
          We may say, ` He is a poet, and likewise a musician; '
          but we should not say, ` He is a prince, and likewise
          a musician,' because there is no natural connection
          between these qualities.'' This distinction, however,
          is often disregarded.
