   other, alius other. Cf. {Else}, {Other}.]

      partially or wholly; to vary; to modify. ``To alter the
      king's course.'' ``To alter the condition of a man.'' ``No
      power in Venice can alter a decree.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            It gilds all objects, but it alters none. --Pope.
      [1913 Webster]

            My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing
            that is gone out of my lips.          --Ps. lxxxix.
                                                  34.

   Syn: {Change}, {Alter}.

   Usage: Change is generic and the stronger term. It may
          express a loss of identity, or the substitution of one
          thing in place of another; alter commonly expresses a
          partial change, or a change in form or details without
          destroying identity.
          [1913 Webster]
