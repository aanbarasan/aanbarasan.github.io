   Syn: To escape; elude; evade; eschew.

   Usage: To {Avoid}, {Shun}. Avoid in its commonest sense

          to withdraw one's self from. It denotes care taken not
          to come near or in contact; as, to avoid certain
          persons or places. Shun is a stronger term, implying
          more prominently the idea of intention. The words may,
          however, in many cases be interchanged.
