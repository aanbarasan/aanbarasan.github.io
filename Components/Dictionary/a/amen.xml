      <WordDefinition>Amen
   This Hebrew word means firm, and hence also faithful (Rev.
   3:14). In Isa. 65:16, the Authorized Version has "the God of
   truth," which in Hebrew is "the God of Amen." It is frequently
   used by our Saviour to give emphasis to his words, where it is
   translated "verily." Sometimes, only, however, in John's Gospel,
   it is repeated, "Verily, verily." It is used as an epithet of
   the Lord Jesus Christ (Rev. 3:14).
   
     It is found singly and sometimes doubly at the end of prayers
   (Ps. 41:13; 72:19; 89:52), to confirm the words and invoke the
   fulfilment of them. It is used in token of being bound by an
   oath (Num. 5:22; Deut. 27:15-26; Neh. 5:13; 8:6; 1 Chr. 16:36).
   In the primitive churches it was common for the general audience
   to say "Amen" at the close of the prayer (1 Cor. 14:16).
   
     The promises of God are Amen; i.e., they are all true and sure
   (2 Cor. 1:20).
