      <WordDefinition>Ashes
   The ashes of a red heifer burned entire (Num. 19:5) when
   sprinkled on the unclean made them ceremonially clean (Heb.
   9:13).
   
     To cover the head with ashes was a token of self-abhorrence
   and humiliation (2 Sam. 13:19; Esther 4:3; Jer. 6:26, etc.).
   
     To feed on ashes (Isa. 44:20), means to seek that which will
   prove to be vain and unsatisfactory, and hence it denotes the
   unsatisfactory nature of idol-worship. (Comp. Hos. 12:1).
