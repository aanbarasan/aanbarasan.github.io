      <WordDefinition>Adulation \Ad`u*la"tion\, n. [F. adulation, fr. L. adulatio, fr.
   adulari, adulatum, to flatter.]
   Servile flattery; praise in excess, or beyond what is
   merited.
   [1913 Webster]

         Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
         With titles blown from adulation?        --Shak.
   [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Sycophancy; cringing; fawning; obsequiousness;
        blandishment.

   Usage: {Adulation}, {Flattery}, {Compliment}. Men deal in
          compliments from a desire to please; they use flattery
          either from undue admiration, or a wish to gratify
          vanity; they practice adulation from sordid motives,
          and with a mingled spirit of falsehood and hypocrisy.
          Compliment may be a sincere expression of due respect
          and esteem, or it may be unmeaning; flattery is apt to
          become gross; adulation is always servile, and usually
          fulsome.
          [1913 Webster]
