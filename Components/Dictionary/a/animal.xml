      <WordDefinition>Animal
   an organized living creature endowed with sensation. The
   Levitical law divided animals into clean and unclean, although
   the distinction seems to have existed before the Flood (Gen.
   7:2). The clean could be offered in sacrifice and eaten. All
   animals that had not cloven hoofs and did not chew the cud were
   unclean. The list of clean and unclean quadrupeds is set forth
   in the Levitical law (Deut. 14:3-20; Lev. 11).
