      <WordDefinition>Anna
   grace, an aged widow, the daughter of Phanuel. She was a
   "prophetess," like Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah (2 Chr. 34:22).
   After seven years of married life her husband died, and during
   her long widowhood she daily attended the temple services. When
   she was eighty-four years old, she entered the temple at the
   moment when the aged Simeon uttered his memorable words of
   praise and thanks to God that he had fulfilled his ancient
   promise in sending his Son into the world (Luke 2:36, 37).
