        2. (CMU, Tektronix) {root}, {superuser}.  There are quite a
        few {Unix} computers on which the name of the superuser
        account is "avatar" rather than "root".  This quirk was
        originated by a {CMU} hacker who disliked the term
        "superuser", and was propagated through an ex-CMU hacker at
        {Tektronix}.

      <WordDefinition>avatar n. Syn. [in Hindu mythology, the incarnation of a god] 1. Among
   people working on virtual reality and {cyberspace} interfaces, an
   "avatar" is an icon or representation of a user in a shared virtual
   reality. The term is sometimes used on {MUD}s. 2. [CMU, Tektronix]
   {root}, {superuser}. There are quite a few Unix machines on which the
   name of the superuser account is `avatar' rather than `root'. This quirk
   was originated by a CMU hacker who found the terms `root' and
   `superuser' unimaginative, and thought `avatar' might better impress
   people with the responsibility they were accepting.
