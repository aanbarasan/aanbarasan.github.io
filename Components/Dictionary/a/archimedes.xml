      <WordDefinition>Archimedes
     
        &lt;computer&gt; A family of {microcomputers} produced by {Acorn
        Computers}, Cambridge, UK.  The Archimedes, launched in June
        1987, was the first {RISC} based {personal computer}
        (predating {Apple Computer}'s {Power Mac} by some seven
        years).  It uses the {Advanced RISC Machine} (ARM) processor
        and includes Acorn's {multitasking} {operating system} and
        {graphical user interface}, {RISC OS} on {ROM}, along with an
        interpreter for Acorn's enhanced {BASIC}, {BASIC V}.
     
        The Archimedes was designed as the successor to Acorn's
        sucessful {BBC Microcomputer} series and includes some
        backward compatibility and a {6502} {emulator}.  Several
        utilities are included free on disk (later in ROM) such as a
        {text editor}, paint and draw programs.  Software emulators
        are also available for the {IBM PC} as well as add-on {Intel}
        processor cards.
     
        There have been several series of Archimedes: A300, A400,
        A3000, A5000, A4000 and {RISC PC}.
