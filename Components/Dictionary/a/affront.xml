   1. An encounter either friendly or hostile. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

   3. An offense to one's self-respect; shame. --Arbuthnot.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: {Affront}, {Insult}, {Outrage}.

   Usage: An affront is a designed mark of disrespect, usually
          in the presence of others. An insult is a personal
          attack either by words or actions, designed to
          humiliate or degrade. An outrage is an act of extreme
          and violent insult or abuse. An affront piques and
          mortifies; an insult irritates and provokes; an
          outrage wounds and injures.

                Captious persons construe every innocent freedom
                into an affront. When people are in a state of
                animosity, they seek opportunities of offering
                each other insults. Intoxication or violent
                passion impels men to the commission of
                outrages.                         --Crabb.
