        opprobrium.

   Usage: {Abuse}, {Invective}. Abuse is generally prompted by
          anger, and vented in harsh and unseemly words. It is
          more personal and coarse than invective. Abuse
          generally takes place in private quarrels; invective
          in writing or public discussions. Invective may be
          conveyed in refined language and dictated by
          indignation against what is blameworthy. --C. J.
          Smith.
          [1913 Webster]
