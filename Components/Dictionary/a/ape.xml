      <WordDefinition>Ape
   an animal of the monkey tribe (1 Kings 10:22; 2 Chr. 9:21). It
   was brought from India by the fleets of Solomon and Hiram, and
   was called by the Hebrews _koph_, and by the Greeks _kepos_,
   both words being just the Indian Tamil name of the monkey, kapi,
   i.e., swift, nimble, active. No species of ape has ever been
   found in Palestine or the adjacent regions.
