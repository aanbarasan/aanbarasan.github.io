      <WordDefinition>Arrows
   At first made of reeds, and then of wood tipped with iron.
   Arrows are sometimes figuratively put for lightning (Deut.
   32:23, 42; Ps. 7:13; 18:14; 144:6; Zech. 9:14). They were used
   in war as well as in the chase (Gen. 27:3; 49:23). They were
   also used in divination (Ezek. 21:21).
   
     The word is frequently employed as a symbol of calamity or
   disease inflicted by God (Job 6:4; 34:6; Ps. 38:2; Deut. 32:23.
   Comp. Ezek. 5:16), or of some sudden danger (Ps. 91:5), or
   bitter words (Ps. 64:3), or false testimony (Prov. 25:18).
