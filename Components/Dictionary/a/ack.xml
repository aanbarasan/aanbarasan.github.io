      <WordDefinition>ACK
     
        1. &lt;character&gt; /ak/ The {mnemonic} for the ACKnowledge
        character, {ASCII} code 6.
     
        2. &lt;communications&gt; A message transmitted to indicate that
        some data has been received correctly.  Typically, if the
        sender does not receive the ACK message after some
        predetermined time, or receives a {NAK}, the original data
        will be sent again.

      <WordDefinition>ACK /ak/ interj. 1. [common; from the ASCII mnemonic for 0000110]
   Acknowledge. Used to register one's presence (compare mainstream _Yo!_).
   An appropriate response to {ping} or {ENQ}. 2. [from the comic strip
   "Bloom County"] An exclamation of surprised disgust, esp. in "Ack
   pffft!" Semi-humorous. Generally this sense is not spelled in caps (ACK)
   and is distinguished by a following exclamation point. 3. Used to
   politely interrupt someone to tell them you understand their point (see
   {NAK}). Thus, for example, you might cut off an overly long explanation
   with "Ack. Ack. Ack. I get it now". 4. An affirmative. "Think we ought
   to ditch that damn NT server for a Linux box?" "ACK!"

   There is also a usage "ACK?" (from sense 1) meaning "Are you there?",
   often used in email when earlier mail has produced no reply, or during a
   lull in {talk mode} to see if the person has gone away (the standard
   humorous response is of course {NAK} (sense 1), i.e., "I'm not here").
