      <WordDefinition>Apparel
   In Old Testament times the distinction between male and female
   attire was not very marked. The statute forbidding men to wear
   female apparel (Deut. 22:5) referred especially to ornaments and
   head-dresses. Both men and women wore (1) an under garment or
   tunic, which was bound by a girdle. One who had only this tunic
   on was spoken of as "naked" (1 Sam. 19:24; Job 24:10; Isa.
   20:2). Those in high stations sometimes wore two tunics, the
   outer being called the "upper garment" (1 Sam. 15:27; 18:4;
   24:5; Job 1:20). (2.) They wore in common an over-garment
   ("mantle," Isa. 3:22; 1 Kings 19:13; 2 Kings 2:13), a loose and
   flowing robe. The folds of this upper garment could be formed
   into a lap (Ruth 3:15; Ps. 79:12; Prov. 17:23; Luke 6:38).
   Generals of armies usually wore scarlet robes (Judg. 8:26; Nah.
   2:3). A form of conspicuous raiment is mentioned in Luke 20:46;
   comp. Matt. 23:5.
   
     Priests alone wore trousers. Both men and women wore turbans.
   Kings and nobles usually had a store of costly garments for
   festive occasions (Isa. 3:22; Zech. 3:4) and for presents (Gen.
   45:22; Esther 4:4; 6:8, 11; 1 Sam. 18:4; 2 Kings 5:5; 10:22).
   Prophets and ascetics wore coarse garments (Isa. 20:2; Zech.
   13:4; Matt. 3:4).
