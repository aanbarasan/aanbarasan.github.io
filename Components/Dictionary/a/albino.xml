      <WordDefinition>Albino \Al*bi"no\ (?; 277), n.; pl. {Albinos}. [Sp. or Pg.
   albino, orig. whitish, fr. albo white, L. albus.]
   A person, whether negro, Indian, or white, in whom by some
   defect of organization the substance which gives color to the
   skin, hair, and eyes is deficient or in a morbid state. An
   albino has a skin of a milky hue, with hair of the same
   color, and eyes with deep red pupil and pink or blue iris.
   The term is also used of the lower animals, as white mice,
   elephants, etc.; and of plants in a whitish condition from
   the absence of chlorophyll. --Amer. Cyc.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The term was originally applied by the Portuguese to
         negroes met with on the coast of Africa, who were
         mottled with white spots.
         [1913 Webster]
