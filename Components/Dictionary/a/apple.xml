      <WordDefinition>Apple
   (Heb. tappuah, meaning "fragrance"). Probably the apricot or
   quince is intended by the word, as Palestine was too hot for the
   growth of apples proper. It is enumerated among the most
   valuable trees of Palestine (Joel 1:12), and frequently referred
   to in Canticles, and noted for its beauty (2:3, 5; 8:5). There
   is nothing to show that it was the "tree of the knowledge of
   good and evil." Dr. Tristram has suggested that the apricot has
   better claims than any other fruit-tree to be the apple of
   Scripture. It grows to a height of 30 feet, has a roundish mass
   of glossy leaves, and bears an orange coloured fruit that gives
   out a delicious perfume. The "apple of the eye" is the Heb.
   _ishon_, meaning manikin, i.e., the pupil of the eye (Prov.
   7:2). (Comp. the promise, Zech. 2:8; the prayer, Ps. 17:8; and
   its fulfilment, Deut. 32:10.)
   
     The so-called "apple of Sodom" some have supposed to be the
   Solanum sanctum (Heb. hedek), rendered "brier" (q.v.) in Micah
   7:4, a thorny plant bearing fruit like the potato-apple. This
   shrub abounds in the Jordan valley. (See {ENGEDI}.)
