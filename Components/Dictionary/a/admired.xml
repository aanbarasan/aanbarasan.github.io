      <WordDefinition>Admire \Ad*mire"\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Admired}; p. pr. &amp; vb.
   n. {Admiring}.] [F. admirer, fr. L. admirari; ad + mirari to
   wonder, for smirari, akin to Gr. ? to smile, Skr. smi, and E.
   smile.]
   1. To regard with wonder or astonishment; to view with
      surprise; to marvel at. [Archaic]
      [1913 Webster]

            Examples rather to be admired than imitated.
                                                  --Fuller.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. To regard with wonder and delight; to look upon with an
      elevated feeling of pleasure, as something which calls out
      approbation, esteem, love, or reverence; to estimate or
      prize highly; as, to admire a person of high moral worth,
      to admire a landscape.
      [1913 Webster]

            Admired as heroes and as gods obeyed. --Pope.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Admire followed by the infinitive is obsolete or
         colloquial; as, I admire to see a man consistent in his
         conduct.
         [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To esteem; approve; delight in.
        [1913 Webster]
