      <WordDefinition>Although \Al*though"\, conj. [All + though; OE. al thagh.]
   Grant all this; be it that; supposing that; notwithstanding;
   though.
   [1913 Webster]

         Although all shall be offended, yet will not I. --Mark
                                                  xiv. 29.
   [1913 Webster]

   Syn: {Although}, {Though}.

   Usage: Although, which originally was perhaps more emphatic
          than though, is now interchangeable with it in the
          sense given above. Euphonic consideration determines
          the choice.
