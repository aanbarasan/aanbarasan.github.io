   alternativa.]
   1. An offer of two things, one of which may be chosen, but
      not both; a choice between two things, so that if one is
      taken, the other must be left.

            absolute destruction or unreformed existence.

      [1913 Webster]

   2. Either of two things or propositions offered to one's
      choice. Thus when two things offer a choice of one only,
      the two things are called {alternatives}.
      [1913 Webster]

            Having to choose between two alternatives, safety
            and war, you obstinately prefer the worse. --Jowett
                                                  (Thucyd.).
      [1913 Webster]

   3. The course of action or the thing offered in place of
      another.
      [1913 Webster]

            If this demand is refused the alternative is war.
                                                  --Lewis.
      [1913 Webster]

            With no alternative but death.        --Longfellow.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. A choice between more than two things; one of several
      things offered to choose among.
      [1913 Webster]

            My decided preference is for the fourth and last of
            these alternatives.                   --Gladstone.
      [1913 Webster]
