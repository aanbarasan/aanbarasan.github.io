      <WordDefinition>ASCII \ASCII\ n. [Acronym: American Standard Code for
   Information Interchange.](Computers)
   1. the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a
      code consisting of a set of 128 7-bit combinations used in
      digital computers internally, for display purposes, and
      for exchanging data between computers. It is very widely
      used, but because of the limited number of characters
      encoded must be supplemented or replaced by other codes
      for encoding special symbols or words in languages other
      than English. Also used attributively; -- as, an ASCII
      file.

   Syn: American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

      <WordDefinition>ASCII /as'kee/ n. [originally an acronym (American Standard Code for
   Information Interchange) but now merely conventional] The predominant
   character set encoding of present-day computers. The standard version
   uses 7 bits for each character, whereas most earlier codes (including
   early drafts of ASCII prior to June 1961) used fewer. This change
   allowed the inclusion of lowercase letters -- a major {win} -- but it
   did not provide for accented letters or any other letterforms not used
   in English (such as the German sharp-S or the ae-ligature which is a
   letter in, for example, Norwegian). It could be worse, though. It could
   be much worse. See {{EBCDIC}} to understand how. A history of ASCII and
   its ancestors is at `http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html'.

   Computers are much pickier and less flexible about spelling than
   humans; thus, hackers need to be very precise when talking about
   characters, and have developed a considerable amount of verbal shorthand
   for them. Every character has one or more names -- some formal, some
   concise, some silly. Common jargon names for ASCII characters are
   collected here. See also individual entries for {bang}, {excl}, {open},
   {ques}, {semi}, {shriek}, {splat}, {twiddle}, and {Yu-Shiang Whole
   Fish}.

   This list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII pronunciation
   guide. Single characters are listed in ASCII order; character pairs are
   sorted in by first member. For each character, common names are given in
   rough order of popularity, followed by names that are reported but
   rarely seen; official ANSI/CCITT names are surrounded by brokets: &lt;&gt;.
   Square brackets mark the particularly silly names introduced by
   {INTERCAL}. The abbreviations "l/r" and "o/c" stand for left/right and
   "open/close" respectively. Ordinary parentheticals provide some usage
   information.

   The pronunciation of `#' as `pound' is common in the U.S. but a bad
   idea; {{Commonwealth Hackish}} has its own, rather more apposite use of
   `pound sign' (confusingly, on British keyboards the pound graphic
   happens to replace `#'; thus Britishers sometimes call `#' on a
   U.S.-ASCII keyboard `pound', compounding the American error). The U.S.
   usage derives from an old-fashioned commercial practice of using a `#'
   suffix to tag pound weights on bills of lading. The character is usually
   pronounced `hash' outside the U.S. There are more culture wars over the
   correct pronunciation of this character than any other, which has led to
   the {ha ha only serious} suggestion that it be pronounced `shibboleth'
   (see Judges 12:6 in an Old Testament or Tanakh).

   The `uparrow' name for circumflex and `leftarrow' name for underline
   are historical relics from archaic ASCII (the 1963 version), which had
   these graphics in those character positions rather than the modern
   punctuation characters.

   The `swung dash' or `approximation' sign is not quite the same as
   tilde in typeset material but the ASCII tilde serves for both (compare
   {angle brackets}).

   Some other common usages cause odd overlaps. The `#', `$', `&gt;', and
   `&amp;' characters, for example, are all pronounced "hex" in different
   communities because various assemblers use them as a prefix tag for
   hexadecimal constants (in particular, `#' in many assembler-programming
   cultures, `$' in the 6502 world, `&gt;' at Texas Instruments, and `&amp;' on
   the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and some Z80 machines). See also {splat}.

   The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the world's
   other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits look more
   and more like a serious {misfeature} as the use of international
   networks continues to increase (see {software rot}). Hardware and
   software from the U.S. still tends to embody the assumption that ASCII
   is the universal character set and that characters have 7 bits; this is
   a major irritant to people who want to use a character set suited to
   their own languages. Perversely, though, efforts to solve this problem
   by proliferating `national' character sets produce an evolutionary
   pressure to use a _smaller_ subset common to all those in use.
