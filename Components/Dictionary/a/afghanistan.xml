   Introduction Afghanistan
   ------------------------
                            Background: Afghanistan's recent history is
                                        characterized by war and civil
                                        strife, with intermittent periods of
                                        relative calm and stability. The
                                        Soviet Union invaded in 1979 but was
                                        forced to withdraw 10 years later by
                                        anti-Communist mujahidin forces
                                        supplied and trained by the US,
                                        Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and others.
                                        Fighting subsequently continued
                                        among the various mujahidin
                                        factions, giving rise to a state of
                                        warlordism that spawned the Taliban
                                        in the early 1990s. The Taliban was
                                        able to seize most of the country,
                                        aside from Northern Alliance
                                        strongholds primarily in the
                                        northeast, until US and allied
                                        military action in support of the
                                        opposition following the 11
                                        September 2001 terrorist attacks
                                        forced the group's downfall. The
                                        four largest Afghan opposition
                                        groups met in Bonn, Germany, in late
                                        2001 and agreed on a plan for the
                                        formulation of a new government
                                        structure that resulted in the
                                        inauguration of Hamid KARZAI as
                                        Chairman of the Afghan Interim
                                        Authority (AIA) on 22 December 2001.
                                        In addition to occasionally violent
                                        political jockeying and ongoing
                                        military action to root out
                                        remaining terrorists and Taliban
                                        elements, the country suffers from
                                        enormous poverty, a crumbling
                                        infrastructure, and widespread land
                                        mines.

   Economy Afghanistan
   -------------------
                    Economy - overview: Afghanistan is an extremely poor,
                                        landlocked country, highly dependent
                                        on farming and livestock raising
                                        (sheep and goats). Economic
                                        considerations have played second
                                        fiddle to political and military
                                        upheavals during two decades of war,
                                        including the nearly 10-year Soviet
                                        military occupation (which ended 15
                                        February 1989). During that conflict
                                        one-third of the population fled the
                                        country, with Pakistan and Iran
                                        sheltering a combined peak of more
                                        than 6 million refugees. Gross
                                        domestic product has fallen
                                        substantially over the past 20 years
                                        because of the loss of labor and
                                        capital and the disruption of trade
                                        and transport; severe drought added
                                        to the nation's difficulties in
                                        1998-2001. The majority of the
                                        population continues to suffer from
                                        insufficient food, clothing,
                                        housing, and medical care, problems
                                        exacerbated by military operations
                                        and political uncertainties.
                                        Inflation remains a serious problem.
                                        Following the US-led coalition war
                                        that led to the defeat of the
                                        Taliban in November 2001 and the
                                        formulation of the Afghan Interim
                                        Authority (AIA) resulting from the

                                        Afghanistan were addressed at the

                                        Reconstruction in January 2002, when
                                        $4.5 billion was collected for a

                                        World Bank. Priority areas for
                                        reconstruction include the
                                        construction of education, health,
                                        and sanitation facilities,
