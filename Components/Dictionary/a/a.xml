   Alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet, as Omega is the
   last. These letters occur in the text of Rev. 1:8,11; 21:6;
   22:13, and are represented by "Alpha" and "Omega" respectively
   (omitted in R.V., 1:11). They mean "the first and last." (Comp.
   Heb. 12:2; Isa. 41:4; 44:6; Rev. 1:11,17; 2:8.) In the symbols
   of the early Christian Church these two letters are frequently
   combined with the cross or with Christ's monogram to denote his
   divinity.

        &lt;language&gt; /A sharp/ A separable component of Version 2 of the
        {AXIOM*} computer algebra system.  It provides a programming
        language with an {optimising compiler}, an {intermediate code}
        {interpreter}, and a library of data structures and
        mathematical {abstraction}s.  The compiler produces
        {stand-alone executable} programs, {object} libraries in
        {native} {operating system} formats, {portable} {bytecode}
        libraries, {C} and {Lisp} {source code}.
     
        The A# programming language has support for {object-oriented}
        and {functional programming} styles.  Both types and functions
        are {first class} values that can be manipulated with a range
        of flexible and composable {primitive}s and user programs.
        The A# language design places particular emphasis on
        compilation for efficient {machine code} and portability.
     
        Ports have been made to various 16, 32, and 64 bit
        architectures: {RS/6000}, {SPARC}, {DEC Alpha}, {i386},

      <WordDefinition>Infinitive \In*fin"i*tive\, n. [L. infinitivus: cf. F.
   infinitif. See {Infinite}.]
   Unlimited; not bounded or restricted; undefined.
   [1913 Webster]

   {Infinitive mood} (Gram.), that form of the verb which merely
      names the action, and performs the office of a verbal
      noun. Some grammarians make two forms in English: ({a})
      The simple form, as, speak, go, hear, before which to is
      commonly placed, as, to speak; to go; to hear. ({b}) The
      form of the imperfect participle, called the infinitive in
      -ing; as, going is as easy as standing.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: With the auxiliary verbs may, can, must, might, could,
         would, and should, the simple infinitive is expressed
         without to; as, you may speak; they must hear, etc. The
         infinitive usually omits to with the verbs let, dare,
         do, bid, make, see, hear, need, etc.; as, let me go;
         you dare not tell; make him work; hear him talk, etc.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: In Anglo-Saxon, the simple infinitive was not preceded
         by to (the sign of modern simple infinitive), but it
         had a dative form (sometimes called the gerundial
         infinitive) which was preceded by to, and was chiefly
         employed in expressing purpose. See {Gerund}, 2.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: The gerundial ending (-anne) not only took the same
         form as the simple infinitive (-an), but it was
         confounded with the present participle in -ende, or
         -inde (later -inge).

         extraordinary legates, the former governing provinces,
         and the latter class being sent to foreign countries on
         extraordinary occasions. ({b}) Legati missi, who
         correspond to the ambassadors of temporal governments.
         ({c}) Legati nati, or legates by virtue of their
         office, as the archbishops of Salzburg and Prague.
         [1913 Webster]

   3. (Rom. Hist.)

   {Libration of the moon}, any one of those small periodical
      changes in the position of the moon's surface relatively
      to the earth, in consequence of which narrow portions at
      opposite limbs become visible or invisible alternately. It
      receives different names according to the manner in which
      it takes place; as: {(a)} Libration in longitude, that
      which, depending on the place of the moon in its elliptic
      orbit, causes small portions near the eastern and western
      borders alternately to appear and disappear each month.
      ({b}) Libration in latitude, that which depends on the
      varying position of the moon's axis in respect to the
      spectator, causing the alternate appearance and
      disappearance of either pole. ({c}) Diurnal or parallactic
      libration, that which brings into view on the upper limb,
      at rising and setting, some parts not in the average
      visible hemisphere.

      <WordDefinition>Respiration \Res`pi*ra"tion\ (r?s`p?*r?"sh?n), n. [L.
   respiratio: cf. F. respiration. See {Respire}.]
   1. The act of respiring or breathing again, or catching one's
      breath.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Relief from toil or suffering: rest. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

            Till the day

      [1913 Webster]

   3. Interval; intermission. [Obs.] --Bp. Hall.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. (Physiol.) The act of resping or breathing; the act of
      taking in and giving out air; the aggregate of those
      processes bu which oxygen is introduced into the system,
      and carbon dioxide, or carbonic acid, removed.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Respiration in the higher animals is divided into:
         ({a}) Internal respiration, or the interchange of
         oxygen and carbonic acid between the cells of the body
         and the bathing them, which in one sense is a process
         of nutrition. ({b}) External respiration, or the
         gaseous interchange taking place in the special
         respiratory organs, the lungs. This constitutes
         respiration proper. --Gamgee.
         [1913 Webster] In the respiration of plants oxygen is
         likewise absorbed and carbonic acid exhaled, but in the
         light this process is obscured by another process which
         goes on with more vigor, in which the plant inhales and
         absorbs carbonic acid and exhales free oxygen.

      <WordDefinition>A \A\ (named [=a] in the English, and most commonly ["a] in
   other languages).
   The first letter of the English and of many other alphabets.
   The capital A of the alphabets of Middle and Western Europe,
   as also the small letter (a), besides the forms in Italic,
   black letter, etc., are all descended from the old Latin A,
   which was borrowed from the Greek {Alpha}, of the same form;
   and this was made from the first letter (?) of the
   Ph[oe]nician alphabet, the equivalent of the Hebrew Aleph,
   and itself from the Egyptian origin. The Aleph was a
   consonant letter, with a guttural breath sound that was not
   an element of Greek articulation; and the Greeks took it to
   represent their vowel Alpha with the ["a] sound, the
   Ph[oe]nician alphabet having no vowel symbols.
   [1913 Webster] This letter, in English, is used for several
   different vowel sounds. See Guide to pronunciation,
   [sect][sect] 43-74. The regular long a, as in fate, etc., is
   a comparatively modern sound, and has taken the place of
   what, till about the early part of the 17th century, was a
   sound of the quality of ["a] (as in far).

      [1913 Webster]

   2. In process of; in the act of; into; to; -- used with
      verbal substantives in -ing which begin with a consonant.
      This is a shortened form of the preposition an (which was
      used before the vowel sound); as in a hunting, a building,
      a begging. ``Jacob, when he was a dying'' --Heb. xi. 21.
      ``We'll a birding together.'' `` It was a doing.'' --Shak.
      ``He burst out a laughing.'' --Macaulay.

   Note: The hyphen may be used to connect a with the verbal
         substantive (as, a-hunting, a-building) or the words
         may be written separately. This form of expression is
         now for the most part obsolete, the a being omitted and
         the verbal substantive treated as a participle.

   1. [Shortened form of an. AS. [=a]n one. See {One}.] An
      adjective, commonly called the indefinite article, and
      signifying one or any, but less emphatically. ``At a
      birth''; ``In a word''; ``At a blow''. --Shak.

   Note: It is placed before nouns of the singular number
         denoting an individual object, or a quality
         individualized, before collective nouns, and also
         before plural nouns when the adjective few or the
         phrase great many or good many is interposed; as, a
         dog, a house, a man; a color; a sweetness; a hundred, a
         fleet, a regiment; a few persons, a great many days. It
         is used for an, for the sake of euphony, before words
         beginning with a consonant sound [for exception of
         certain words beginning with h, see {An}]; as, a table,
         a woman, a year, a unit, a eulogy, a ewe, a oneness,
         such a one, etc. Formally an was used both before
         vowels and consonants.

   2. [Originally the preposition a (an, on).] In each; to or
      for each; as, ``twenty leagues a day'', ``a hundred pounds

      <WordDefinition>A- \A-\
   A, as a prefix to English words, is derived from various
   sources. (1) It frequently signifies on or in (from an, a
   forms of AS. on), denoting a state, as in afoot, on foot,
   abed, amiss, asleep, aground, aloft, away (AS. onweg), and
   analogically, ablaze, atremble, etc. (2) AS. of off, from, as
   in adown (AS. ofd[=u]ne off the dun or hill). (3) AS. [=a]-
   (Goth. us-, ur-, Ger. er-), usually giving an intensive
   force, and sometimes the sense of away, on, back, as in
   arise, abide, ago. (4) Old English y- or i- (corrupted from
   the AS. inseparable particle ge-, cognate with OHG. ga-, gi-,
   Goth. ga-), which, as a prefix, made no essential addition to
   the meaning, as in aware. (5) French [`a] (L. ad to), as in
   abase, achieve. (6) L. a, ab, abs, from, as in avert. (7)
   Greek insep. prefix [alpha] without, or privative, not, as in
   abyss, atheist; akin to E. un-.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Besides these, there are other sources from which the
         prefix a takes its origin.

      <WordDefinition>Ferment \Fer"ment\, n. [L. fermentum ferment (in senses 1 &amp; 2),
   perh. for fervimentum, fr. fervere to be boiling hot, boil,
   ferment: cf. F. ferment. Cf. 1st {Barm}, {Fervent}.]
   1. That which causes fermentation, as yeast, barm, or
      fermenting beer.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Ferments are of two kinds: ({a}) Formed or organized
         ferments. ({b}) Unorganized or structureless ferments.
         The latter are now called {enzymes} and were formerly
         called {soluble ferments} or {chemical ferments}.
         Ferments of the first class are as a rule simple
         microscopic vegetable organisms, and the fermentations
         which they engender are due to their growth and
         development; as, the {acetic ferment}, the {butyric
         ferment}, etc. See {Fermentation}. Ferments of the
         second class, on the other hand, are chemical
         substances; as a rule they are proteins soluble in
         glycerin and precipitated by alcohol. In action they
         are catalytic and, mainly, hydrolytic. Good examples
         are pepsin of the dastric juice, ptyalin of the salvia,
         and disease of malt. Before 1960 the term "ferment" to
         mean "enzyme" fell out of use. Enzymes are now known to
         be {globular protein}s, capable of catalyzing a wide
         variety of chemical reactions, not merely hydrolytic.
         The full set of enzymes causing production of ethyl
         alcohol from sugar has been identified and individually
         purified and studied. See {enzyme}.
         [1913 Webster +PJC]

   2. Intestine motion; heat; tumult; agitation.
      [1913 Webster]

            Subdue and cool the ferment of desire. --Rogers.
      [1913 Webster]

            the nation is in a ferment.           --Walpole.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. A gentle internal motion of the constituent parts of a
      fluid; fermentation. [R.]
      [1913 Webster]

            Down to the lowest lees the ferment ran. --Thomson.
      [1913 Webster]

   {ferment oils}, volatile oils produced by the fermentation of
      plants, and not originally contained in them. These were
      the quintessences of the alchemists. --Ure.
