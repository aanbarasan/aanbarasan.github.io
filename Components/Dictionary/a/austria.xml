   Introduction Austria
   --------------------
                            Background: Once the center of power for the
                                        large Austro-Hungarian Empire,
                                        Austria was reduced to a small
                                        republic after its defeat in World
                                        War I. Following annexation by Nazi
                                        Germany in 1938 and subsequent
                                        occupation by the victorious Allies
                                        in 1945, Austria's status remained
                                        unclear for a decade. A State Treaty
                                        signed in 1955 ended the occupation,
                                        recognized Austria's independence,
                                        and forbade unification with
                                        Germany. A constitutional law of
                                        that same year declared the
                                        country's "perpetual neutrality" as
                                        a condition for Soviet military
                                        withdrawal. This neutrality, once
                                        ingrained as part of the Austrian
                                        cultural identity, has been called
                                        into question since the Soviet
                                        collapse of 1991 and Austria's entry
                                        into the European Union in 1995. A
                                        prosperous country, Austria entered
                                        the European Monetary Union in 1999.

                                        because of steep slopes, poor soils,
                                        and low temperatures elsewhere

   Economy Austria
   ---------------
                    Economy - overview: Austria, with its well-developed
                                        market economy and high standard of
                                        living, is closely tied to other EU
                                        economies, especially Germany's.
                                        Membership in the EU has drawn an
                                        influx of foreign investors
                                        attracted by Austria's access to the
                                        single European market and proximity
                                        to EU aspirant economies. Slowing
                                        growth in Germany and elsewhere in
                                        the world slowed the economy to only
                                        1.2% growth in 2001; the economy is
                                        expected to do little better in
                                        2002. To meet increased competition
                                        from both EU and Central European
                                        countries, Austria will need to
                                        emphasize knowledge-based sectors of
                                        the economy, continue to deregulate
                                        the service sector, and lower its
                                        tax burden.
