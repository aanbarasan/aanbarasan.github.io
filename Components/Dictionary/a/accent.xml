      <WordDefinition>Accent \Ac"cent`\, n. [F. accent, L. accentus; ad + cantus a
   singing, canere to sing. See {Cant}.]
   1. A superior force of voice or of articulative effort upon
      some particular syllable of a word or a phrase,
      distinguishing it from the others.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Many English words have two accents, the primary and
         the secondary; the primary being uttered with a greater
         stress of voice than the secondary; as in as'pira"tion,
         where the chief stress is on the third syllable, and a
         slighter stress on the first. Some words, as
         an'tiap'o-plec"tic, in-com'pre-hen'si-bil"i-ty, have
         two secondary accents. See Guide to Pron., [th][th]
         30-46.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. A mark or character used in writing, and serving to
      regulate the pronunciation; esp.:
      (a) a mark to indicate the nature and place of the spoken
          accent;
      (b) a mark to indicate the quality of sound of the vowel
          marked; as, the French accents.
          [1913 Webster]

   Note: In the ancient Greek the acute accent (') meant a
         raised tone or pitch, the grave (`), the level tone or
         simply the negation of accent, the circumflex ( ~ or ^)
         a tone raised and then depressed. In works on
         elocution, the first is often used to denote the rising
         inflection of the voice; the second, the falling
         inflection; and the third (^), the compound or waving
         inflection. In dictionaries, spelling books, and the
         like, the acute accent is used to designate the
         syllable which receives the chief stress of voice.
         [1913 Webster]

   3. Modulation of the voice in speaking; manner of speaking or
      pronouncing; peculiar or characteristic modification of
      the voice; tone; as, a foreign accent; a French or a
      German accent. ``Beguiled you in a plain accent.'' --Shak.
      ``A perfect accent.'' --Thackeray.
      [1913 Webster]

            The tender accent of a woman's cry.   --Prior.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. A word; a significant tone; (pl.) expressions in general;
      speech.
      [1913 Webster]

            Winds! on your wings to Heaven her accents bear,
            Such words as Heaven alone is fit to hear. --Dryden.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. (Pros.) Stress laid on certain syllables of a verse.
      [1913 Webster]

   6. (Mus.)
      (a) A regularly recurring stress upon the tone to mark the
          beginning, and, more feebly, the third part of the
          measure.
      (b) A special emphasis of a tone, even in the weaker part
          of the measure.
      (c) The rhythmical accent, which marks phrases and
          sections of a period.
      (d) The expressive emphasis and shading of a passage. --J.
          S. Dwight.
          [1913 Webster]

   7. (Math.)
      (a) A mark placed at the right hand of a letter, and a
          little above it, to distinguish magnitudes of a
          similar kind expressed by the same letter, but
          differing in value, as y', y[sec].
      (b) (Trigon.) A mark at the right hand of a number,
          indicating minutes of a degree, seconds, etc.; as,
          12'27[sec], i. e., twelve minutes twenty seven
          seconds.
      (c) (Engin.) A mark used to denote feet and inches; as, 6'
          10[sec] is six feet ten inches.
          [1913 Webster]
