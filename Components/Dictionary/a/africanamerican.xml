      <WordDefinition>Hyphenated American \Hyphenated American\
   An American who is referred to by a hyphenated term with the
   first word indicating an origin in a foreign country, and the
   second term being ``American'', as {Irish-American},
   {Italian-American}, {African-American}, {Asian-American}.
   Used in reference to Americans of foreign birth or ancestry.
   When used of Americans of European ancestry, it is often used
   to refer to those who have a strong attachment to the
   ancestral country or its culture. It implies that the
   individual is imperfectly assimilated into American culture,
   and is sometimes used derogatively.
