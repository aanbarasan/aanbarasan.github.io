                                                  23.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To astonish; astound; confound; bewilder; perplex;
        surprise.

   Usage: {Amaze}, {Astonish}. Amazement includes the notion of
          bewilderment of difficulty accompanied by surprise. It
          expresses a state in which one does not know what to
          do, or to say, or to think. Hence we are amazed at
          what we can not in the least account for. Astonishment
          also implies surprise. It expresses a state in which
          one is stunned by the vastness or greatness of
          something, or struck with some degree of horror, as
          when one is overpowered by the ?normity of an act,
          etc.
