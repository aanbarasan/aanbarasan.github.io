      <WordDefinition>Ambiguity \Am`bi*gu"i*ty\, n.; pl. {Ambiguities}. [L.
   ambiguitas, fr. ambiguus: cf. F. ambiguit['e].]
   The quality or state of being ambiguous; doubtfulness or
   uncertainty, particularly as to the signification of
   language, arising from its admitting of more than one
   meaning; an equivocal word or expression.
   [1913 Webster]

         No shadow of ambiguity can rest upon the course to be
         pursued.                                 --I. Taylor.
   [1913 Webster]

         The words are of single signification, without any
         ambiguity.                               --South.
   [1913 Webster]
