   Introduction Andorra
   --------------------
                            Background: Long isolated and impoverished,
                                        mountainous Andorra has achieved
                                        considerable prosperity since World
                                        War II through its tourist industry.
                                        Many immigrants (legal and illegal)
                                        are attracted to the thriving
                                        economy with its lack of income
                                        taxes.

   Economy Andorra
   ---------------
                    Economy - overview: Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's
                                        tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts
                                        for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated
                                        9 million tourists visit annually,
                                        attracted by Andorra's duty-free
                                        status and by its summer and winter
                                        resorts. Andorra's comparative
                                        advantage has recently eroded as the
                                        economies of neighboring France and
                                        Spain have been opened up, providing
                                        broader availability of goods and
                                        lower tariffs. The banking sector,
                                        with its "tax haven" status, also
                                        contributes substantially to the
                                        economy. Agricultural production is
                                        limited - only 2% of the land is
                                        arable - and most food has to be
                                        imported. The principal livestock
                                        activity is sheep raising.
                                        Manufacturing output consists mainly
                                        of cigarettes, cigars, and
                                        furniture. Andorra is a member of
                                        the EU Customs Union and is treated
                                        as an EU member for trade in
                                        manufactured goods (no tariffs) and
                                        as a non-EU member for agricultural
                                        products.
