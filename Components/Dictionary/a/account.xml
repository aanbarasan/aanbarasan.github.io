      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Narrative; narration; relation; recital; description;
        explanation; rehearsal.

   Usage: {Account}, {Narrative}, {Narration}, {Recital}. These
          words are applied to different modes of rehearsing a
          series of events. {Account} turns attention not so
          much to the speaker as to the fact related, and more
          properly applies to the report of some single event,
          or a group of incidents taken as whole; as, an
          {account} of a battle, of a shipwreck, etc. A
          {narrative} is a continuous story of connected
          incidents, such as one friend might tell to another;
          as, a {narrative} of the events of a siege, a
          {narrative} of one's life, etc. {Narration} is usually
          the same as {narrative}, but is sometimes used to
          describe the {mode} of relating events; as, his powers
          of {narration} are uncommonly great. {Recital} denotes
          a series of events drawn out into minute particulars,
          usually expressing something which peculiarly
          interests the feelings of the speaker; as, the
          {recital} of one's wrongs, disappointments,
          sufferings, etc.
