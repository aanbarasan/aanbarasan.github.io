      <WordDefinition>Air
   the atmosphere, as opposed to the higher regions of the sky (1
   Thess. 4:17; Rev. 9:2; 16:17). This word occurs once as the
   rendering of the Hebrew _ruah_ (Job 41:16); elsewhere it is the
   rendering of _shamaiyim_, usually translated "heavens."
   
     The expression "to speak into the air" (1 Cor. 14:9) is a
   proverb denoting to speak in vain, as to "beat the air" (1 Cor.
   9:26) denotes to labour in vain.
