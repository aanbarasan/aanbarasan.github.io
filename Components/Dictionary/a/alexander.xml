      <WordDefinition>Alexander
   man-defender. (1.) A relative of Annas the high priest, present
   when Peter and John were examined before the Sanhedrim (Acts
   4:6).
   
     (2.) A man whose father, Simon the Cyrenian, bore the cross of
   Christ (Mark 15:21).
   
     (3.) A Jew of Ephesus who took a prominent part in the uproar
   raised there by the preaching of Paul (Acts 19:33). The Jews put
   him forward to plead their cause before the mob. It was probably
   intended that he should show that he and the other Jews had no
   sympathy with Paul any more than the Ephesians had. It is
   possible that this man was the same as the following.
   
     (4.) A coppersmith who, with Hymenaeus and others, promulgated
   certain heresies regarding the resurrection (1 Tim. 1:19; 2 Tim.
   4:14), and made shipwreck of faith and of a good conscience.
   Paul excommunicated him (1 Tim. 1:20; comp. 1 Cor. 5:5).
