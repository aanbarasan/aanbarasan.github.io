   6. On; in continuance; without intermission or delay; as,

   Note: It is much used in phrases signifying moving or going
         from; as, go away, run away, etc.; all signifying
         departure, or separation to a distance. Sometimes
         without the verb; as, whither away so fast ? ``Love
         hath wings, and will away.'' --Waller. It serves to
         modify the sense of certain verbs by adding that of
         removal, loss, parting with, etc.; as, to throw away;
         to trifle away; to squander away, etc. Sometimes it has
         merely an intensive force; as, to blaze away.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Away with}, bear, abide. [Obs. or Archaic] ``The calling of
      assemblies, I can not away with.'' (--Isa. i. 13), i. e.,
      ``I can not bear or endure [it].''

   {Away with} one, signifies, take him away. ``Away with him,
      crucify him.'' --John xix. 15.

   {To make away with}.
      (a) To kill or destroy.
      (b) To carry off.
          [1913 Webster]
