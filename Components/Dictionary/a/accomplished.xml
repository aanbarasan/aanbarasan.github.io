   accomplir, F. accomplir; L. ad + complere to fill up,
   complete. See {Complete}, {Finish}.]
   1. To complete, as time or distance.
      [1913 Webster]

      [1913 Webster]

   2. To bring to an issue of full success; to effect; to
      perform; to execute fully; to fulfill; as, to accomplish a
      design, an object, a promise.

   3. To equip or furnish thoroughly; hence, to complete in
      acquirements; to render accomplished; to polish.
      [1913 Webster]

            The armorers accomplishing the knights. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

                                                  Clarke.

   4. To gain; to obtain. [Obs.] --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To do; perform; fulfill; realize; effect; effectuate;
        complete; consummate; execute; achieve; perfect; equip;
        furnish.

   Usage: To {Accomplish}, {Effect}, {Execute}, {Achieve},
          {Perform}. These words agree in the general idea of
          carrying out to some end proposed. To accomplish (to
          fill up to the measure of the intention) generally
          implies perseverance and skill; as, to accomplish a
          plan proposed by one's self, an object, a design, an
          undertaking. ``Thou shalt accomplish my desire.'' --1
          Kings v. 9.
          [1913 Webster]

                He . . . expressed his desire to see a union

                                                  --Macaulay.
          [1913 Webster] To effect (to work out) is much like
          accomplish. It usually implies some degree of
          difficulty contended with; as, he effected or
          accomplished what he intended, his purpose, but
          little. ``What he decreed, he effected.'' --Milton.
          [1913 Webster]

                To work in close design by fraud or guile
                What force effected not.          --Milton.
          [1913 Webster] To execute (to follow out to the end,
          to carry out, or into effect) implies a set mode of
          operation; as, to execute the laws or the orders of
          another; to execute a work, a purpose, design, plan,
          project. To perform is much like to do, though less
          generally applied. It conveys a notion of protracted
          and methodical effort; as, to perform a mission, a
          part, a task, a work. ``Thou canst best perform that
          office.'' --Milton.
          [1913 Webster]

                The Saints, like stars, around his seat
                Perform their courses still.      --Keble.
          [1913 Webster] To achieve (to come to the end or
          arrive at one's purpose) usually implies some
          enterprise or undertaking of importance, difficulty,
          and excellence.
          [1913 Webster]
