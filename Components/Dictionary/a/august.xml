      <WordDefinition>August \Au"gust\, n. [L. Augustus. See note below, and {August},
   a.]
   The eighth month of the year, containing thirty-one days.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The old Roman name was Sextilis, the sixth month from
         March, the month in which the primitive Romans, as well
         as Jews, began the year. The name was changed to August
         in honor of Augustus C[ae]sar, the first emperor of
         Rome, on account of his victories, and his entering on
         his first consulate in that month.
         [1913 Webster]
