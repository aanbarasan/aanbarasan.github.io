      <WordDefinition>Ant
   (Heb. nemalah, from a word meaning to creep, cut off, destroy),
   referred to in Prov. 6:6; 30:25, as distinguished for its
   prudent habits. Many ants in Palestine feed on animal
   substances, but others draw their nourishment partly or
   exclusively from vegetables. To the latter class belongs the ant
   to which Solomon refers. This ant gathers the seeds in the
   season of ripening, and stores them for future use; a habit that
   has been observed in ants in Texas, India, and Italy.

      <WordDefinition>Ant \Ant\, n. [OE. ante, amete, emete, AS. [ae]mete akin to G.
   ameise. Cf. {Emmet}.] (Zo["o]l.)
   A hymenopterous insect of the Linn[ae]an genus {Formica},
   which is now made a family of several genera; an emmet; a
   pismire.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Among ants, as among bees, there are neuter or working
         ants, besides the males and females; the former are
         without wings. Ants live together in swarms, usually
         raising hillocks of earth, variously chambered within,
         where they maintain a perfect system of order, store
         their provisions, and nurture their young. There are
         many species, with diverse habits, as agricultural
         ants, carpenter ants, honey ants, foraging ants, amazon
         ants, etc. The white ants or Termites belong to the
         Neuroptera.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Ant bird} (Zo["o]l.), one of a very extensive group of South
      American birds ({Formicariid[ae]}), which live on ants.
      The family includes many species, some of which are called
      {ant shrikes}, {ant thrushes}, and {ant wrens}.

   {Ant rice} (Bot.), a species of grass ({Aristida oligantha})
      cultivated by the agricultural ants of Texas for the sake
      of its seed.
