   Syn: {Addict}, {Devote}, {Consecrate}, {Dedicate}. Addict was
        formerly used in a good sense; as, addicted to letters;
        but is now mostly employed in a bad sense or an
        indifferent one; as, addicted to vice; addicted to
        sensual indulgence. ``Addicted to staying at home.''
        --J. S. Mill. Devote is always taken in a good sense,
        expressing habitual earnestness in the pursuit of some
        favorite object; as, devoted to science. Consecrate and
        dedicate express devotion of a higher kind, involving
        religious sentiment; as, consecrated to the service of
        the church; dedicated to God.
        [1913 Webster]
