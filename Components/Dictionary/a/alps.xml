        &lt;language&gt; 1. An early interpreted {algebraic language} for
        the {Bendix G15} by Richard V. Andree of the {University of
        Oklahoma}.  ALPS is said to have preceded and influenced
        development of {BASIC}.
     
        Dale Peters &lt;dpeters@theshop.net&gt; reports that in the summer
        of 1966 he attended the second year of an {NSF}-sponsored
        summer institute in mathematics and computing at the
        University of Oklahoma.  Richard Andree taught the computing
        class which mostly used the language GO-GO which was later
        renamed ALPS.  Andree, Harold Wiebe, Ralph Howenstein, and
        another grad student were changing the language frequently
        during the class, which was occasionally a little
        disorienting.  Dale believes it was used in the previous
        summer as well and that it was about this time that Kemeny
        (one of the designers of BASIC) saw it during a visit.
     
        2. A parallel {logic language}.
