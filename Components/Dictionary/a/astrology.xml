      <WordDefinition>Astrology \As*trol"o*gy\ ([a^]s*tr[o^]l"[-o]*j[y^]), n. [F.
   astrologie, L. astrologia, fr. Gr. 'astrologi`a, fr.
   'astrolo`gos astronomer, astrologer; 'asth`r star + lo`gos
   discourse, le`gein to speak. See {Star}.]
   In its etymological signification, the science of the stars;
   among the ancients, synonymous with astronomy; subsequently,
   the art of judging of the influences of the stars upon human
   affairs, and of foretelling events by their position and
   aspects.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Astrology was much in vogue during the Middle Ages, and
         became the parent of modern astronomy, as alchemy did
         of chemistry. It was divided into two kinds: judicial
         astrology, which assumed to foretell the fate and acts
         of nations and individuals, and natural astrology,
         which undertook to predict events of inanimate nature,
         such as changes of the weather, etc.
