      <WordDefinition>Attempt \At*tempt"\, n.
   A essay, trial, or endeavor; an undertaking; an attack, or an
   effort to gain a point; esp. an unsuccessful, as contrasted
   with a successful, effort.
   [1913 Webster]

   [1913 Webster]

   {Attempt to commit a crime} (Law), such an intentional
      preparatory act as will apparently result, if not
      extrinsically hindered, in a crime which it was designed
      to effect. --Wharton.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: {Attempt}, {Endeavor}, {Effort}, {Exertion}, {Trial}.

   Usage: These words agree in the idea of calling forth our
          powers into action. Trial is the generic term; it
          denotes a putting forth of one's powers with a view to
          determine what they can accomplish; as, to make trial
          of one's strength. An attempt is always directed to
          some definite and specific object; as, ``The attempt,
          and not the deed, confounds us.'' --Shak. An endeavor
          is a continued attempt; as, ``His high endeavor and
          his glad success.'' --Cowper. Effort is a specific
          putting forth of strength in order to carry out an
          attempt. Exertion is the putting forth or active
          exercise of any faculty or power. ``It admits of all
          degrees of effort and even natural action without
          effort.'' --C. J. Smith. See {Try}.
