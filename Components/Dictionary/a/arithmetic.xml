      <WordDefinition>Mathematics \Math`e*mat"ics\, n. [F. math['e]matiques, pl., L.
   mathematica, sing., Gr. ? (sc. ?) science. See {Mathematic},
   and {-ics}.]
   That science, or class of sciences, which treats of the exact
   relations existing between quantities or magnitudes, and of
   the methods by which, in accordance with these relations,
   quantities sought are deducible from other quantities known
   or supposed; the science of spatial and quantitative
   relations.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Mathematics embraces three departments, namely: 1.
         {Arithmetic}. 2. {Geometry}, including {Trigonometry}
         and {Conic Sections}. 3. {Analysis}, in which letters
         are used, including {Algebra}, {Analytical Geometry},
         and {Calculus}. Each of these divisions is divided into
         pure or abstract, which considers magnitude or quantity
         abstractly, without relation to matter; and mixed or
         applied, which treats of magnitude as subsisting in
         material bodies, and is consequently interwoven with
         physical considerations.
