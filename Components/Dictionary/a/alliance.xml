      <WordDefinition>Alliance
   a treaty between nations, or between individuals, for their
   mutual advantage.
   
     Abraham formed an alliance with some of the Canaanitish
   princes (Gen. 14:13), also with Abimelech (21:22-32). Joshua and
   the elders of Israel entered into an alliance with the
   Gibeonites (Josh. 9:3-27). When the Israelites entered Palestine
   they were forbidden to enter into alliances with the inhabitants
   of the country (Lev. 18:3, 4; 20:22, 23).
   
     Solomon formed a league with Hiram (1 Kings 5:12). This
   "brotherly covenant" is referred to 250 years afterwards (Amos
   1:9). He also appears to have entered into an alliance with
   Pharaoh (1 Kings 10:28, 29).
   
     In the subsequent history of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel
   various alliances were formed between them and also with
   neighbouring nations at different times.
   
     From patriarchal times a covenant of alliance was sealed by
   the blood of some sacrificial victim. The animal sacrificed was
   cut in two (except birds), and between these two parts the
   persons contracting the alliance passed (Gen. 15:10). There are
   frequent allusions to this practice (Jer. 34:18). Such alliances
   were called "covenants of salt" (Num. 18:19; 2 Chr. 13:5), salt
   being the symbol of perpetuity. A pillar was set up as a
   memorial of the alliance between Laban and Jacob (Gen. 31:52).
   The Jews throughout their whole history attached great
   importance to fidelity to their engagements. Divine wrath fell
   upon the violators of them (Josh. 9:18; 2 Sam. 21:1, 2; Ezek.
   17:16).
