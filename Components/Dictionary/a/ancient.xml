      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Old; primitive; pristine; antique; antiquated;
        old-fashioned; obsolete.

   Usage: {Ancient}, {Antiquated}, {Obsolete}, {Antique},
          {Antic}, {Old}. -- Ancient is opposed to modern, and
          has antiquity; as, an ancient family, ancient
          landmarks, ancient institutions, systems of thought,
          etc. Antiquated describes that which has gone out of
          use or fashion; as, antiquated furniture, antiquated
          laws, rules, etc. Obsolete is commonly used, instead
          of antiquated, in reference to language, customs,
          etc.; as, an obsolete word or phrase, an obsolete
          expression. Antique is applied, in present usage,
          either to that which has come down from the ancients;
          as, an antique cameo, bust, etc.; or to that which is
          made to imitate some ancient work of art; as, an
          antique temple. In the days of Shakespeare, antique
          was often used for ancient; as, ``an antique song,''
          ``an antique Roman;'' and hence, from singularity
          often attached to what is ancient, it was used in the
          sense of grotesque; as, ``an oak whose antique root
          peeps out; '' and hence came our present word antic,
          denoting grotesque or ridiculous. We usually apply
          both ancient and old to things subject to gradual
          decay. We say, an old man, an ancient record; but
          never, the old stars, an old river or mountain. In
          general, however, ancient is opposed to modern, and
          old to new, fresh, or recent. When we speak of a thing
          that existed formerly, which has ceased to exist, we
          commonly use ancient; as, ancient republics, ancient
          heroes; and not old republics, old heroes. But when
          the thing which began or existed in former times is
          still in existence, we use either ancient or old; as,
          ancient statues or paintings, or old statues or
          paintings; ancient authors, or old authors, meaning
          books.
