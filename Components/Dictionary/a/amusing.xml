      [1913 Webster]

      pleasing or mirthful emotions; to divert.

                                                  --Johnson.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To entertain; gratify; please; divert; beguile; deceive;
        occupy.

   Usage: To {Amuse}, {Divert}, {Entertain}. We are amused by
          that which occupies us lightly and pleasantly. We are
          entertained by that which brings our minds into
          agreeable contact with others, as conversation, or a
          book. We are diverted by that which turns off our
          thoughts to something of livelier interest, especially
          of a sportive nature, as a humorous story, or a
          laughable incident.
          [1913 Webster]

                Whatever amuses serves to kill time, to lull the
                faculties, and to banish reflection. Whatever
                entertains usually awakens the understanding or
                gratifies the fancy. Whatever diverts is lively
                in its nature, and sometimes tumultuous in its
                effects.                          --Crabb.
