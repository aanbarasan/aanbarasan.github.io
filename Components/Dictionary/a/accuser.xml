      <WordDefinition>Accuser
   Satan is styled the "accuser of the brethren" (Rev. 12:10. Comp.
   Job 1:6; Zech. 3:1), as seeking to uphold his influence among
   men by bringing false charges against Christians, with the view
   of weakening their influence and injuring the cause with which
   they are identified. He was regarded by the Jews as the accuser
   of men before God, laying to their charge the violations of the
   law of which they were guilty, and demanding their punishment.
   The same Greek word, rendered "accuser," is found in John 8:10
   (but omitted in the Revised Version); Acts 23:30, 35; 24:8;
   25:16, 18, in all of which places it is used of one who brings a
   charge against another.
