      <WordDefinition>Armenia
   high land, occurs only in Authorized Version, 2 Kings 19:37; in
   Revised Version, "Ararat," which is the Hebrew word. A country
   in western Asia lying between the Caspian and the Black Sea.
   Here the ark of Noah rested after the Deluge (Gen. 8:4). It is
   for the most part high table-land, and is watered by the Aras,
   the Kur, the Euphrates, and the Tigris. Ararat was properly the
   name of a part of ancient Armenia. Three provinces of Armenia
   are mentioned in Jer. 51:27, Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz. Some,
   however, think Minni a contraction for Armenia. (See {ARARAT}.)

   Introduction Armenia
   --------------------
                            Background: An Armenian Apostolic Christian
                                        country, Armenia was incorporated
                                        into Russia in 1828 and the USSR in
                                        1920. Armenian leaders remain
                                        preoccupied by the long conflict
                                        with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-
                                        Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-
                                        populated region, assigned to Soviet
                                        Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow.
                                        Armenia and Azerbaijan began
                                        fighting over the area in 1988; the
                                        struggle escalated after both
                                        countries attained independence from
                                        the Soviet Union in 1991. By May
                                        1994, when a cease-fire took hold,
                                        Armenian forces held not only
                                        Nagorno-Karabakh but also a
                                        significant portion of Azerbaijan
                                        proper. The economies of both sides
                                        have been hurt by their inability to
                                        make substantial progress toward a
                                        peaceful resolution.

   Economy Armenia
   ---------------
                    Economy - overview: Under the old Soviet central
                                        planning system, Armenia had
                                        developed a modern industrial
                                        sector, supplying machine tools,
                                        textiles, and other manufactured
                                        goods to sister republics in
                                        exchange for raw materials and
                                        energy. Since the implosion of the
                                        USSR in December 1991, Armenia has
                                        switched to small-scale agriculture
                                        away from the large agroindustrial
                                        complexes of the Soviet era. The
                                        agricultural sector has long-term
                                        needs for more investment and
                                        updated technology. The
                                        privatization of industry has been
                                        at a slower pace, but has been given
                                        renewed emphasis by the current
                                        administration. Armenia is a food
                                        importer, and its mineral deposits
                                        (gold, bauxite) are small. The
                                        ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan
                                        over the ethnic Armenian-dominated
                                        region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the
                                        breakup of the centrally directed
                                        economic system of the former Soviet
                                        Union contributed to a severe
                                        economic decline in the early 1990s.
                                        By 1994, however, the Armenian
                                        Government had launched an ambitious
                                        IMF-sponsored economic program that
                                        has resulted in positive growth
                                        rates in 1995-2001. Armenia also
                                        managed to slash inflation and to
                                        privatize most small- and medium-
                                        sized enterprises. The chronic
                                        energy shortages Armenia suffered in
                                        recent years have been largely
                                        offset by the energy supplied by one
                                        of its nuclear power plants at
                                        Metsamor. Armenia's severe trade
                                        imbalance has been offset somewhat
                                        by international aid, domestic
                                        restructuring of the economy, and
                                        foreign direct investment.
