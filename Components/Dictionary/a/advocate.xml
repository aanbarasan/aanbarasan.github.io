      <WordDefinition>Advocate
   (Gr. parakletos), one who pleads another's cause, who helps
   another by defending or comforting him. It is a name given by
   Christ three times to the Holy Ghost (John 14:16; 15:26; 16:7,
   where the Greek word is rendered "Comforter," q.v.). It is
   applied to Christ in 1 John 2:1, where the same Greek word is
   rendered "Advocate," the rendering which it should have in all
   the places where it occurs. Tertullus "the orator" (Acts 24:1)
   was a Roman advocate whom the Jews employed to accuse Paul
   before Felix.
