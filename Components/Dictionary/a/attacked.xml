   Syn: To {Attack}, {Assail}, {Assault}, {Invade}.

   Usage: These words all denote a violent onset; attack being
          the generic term, and the others specific forms of
          attack. To attack is to commence the onset; to assail
          is to make a sudden and violent attack, or to make
          repeated attacks; to assault (literally, to leap upon)
          is to attack physically by a had-to-hand approach or
          by unlawful and insulting violence; to invade is to
          enter by force on what belongs to another. Thus, a
          person may attack by offering violence of any kind; he
          may assail by means of missile weapons; he may assault
          by direct personal violence; a king may invade by
          marching an army into a country. Figuratively, we may
          say, men attack with argument or satire; they assail
          with abuse or reproaches; they may be assaulted by
          severe temptations; the rights of the people may be
          invaded by the encroachments of the crown.
          [1913 Webster]
