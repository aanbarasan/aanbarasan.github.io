      <WordDefinition>Autumn \Au"tumn\, n. [L. auctumnus, autumnus, perh. fr. a root
   av to satisfy one's self: cf. F. automne. See {Avarice}.]
   1. The third season of the year, or the season between summer
      and winter, often called ``the {fall}.'' Astronomically,
      it begins in the northern temperate zone at the autumnal
      equinox, about September 23, and ends at the winter
      solstice, about December 23; but in popular language,
      autumn, in America, comprises September, October, and
      November.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In England, according to Johnson, autumn popularly
         comprises August, September, and October. In the
         southern hemisphere, the autumn corresponds to our
         spring.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. The harvest or fruits of autumn. --Milton.

            duke's favor.                         --Fuller.
      [1913 Webster]

            Life's autumn past, I stand on winter's verge.
                                                  --Wordsworth.
      [1913 Webster]
