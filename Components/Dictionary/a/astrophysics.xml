      <WordDefinition>Astrophysics \As`tro*phys"ics\, n. [Astro- + physics.] (Astron.)
   The science treating of the physical characteristics of the
   stars and other heavenly bodies, their chemical constitution,
   light, heat, atmospheres, etc. It is a branch of astronomy.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Its observations were traditionally made with the
         spectroscope, bolometer, etc., usually in connection
         with the telescope. In modern times, radiotelescopes,
         infrared telescopes, X-ray and gamma ray detectors and
         neutrino detection equipment located deep underground
         are all put into service to observe and test theories
         about astronomical phenomena.
