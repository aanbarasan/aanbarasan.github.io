      <WordDefinition>Asia
   is used to denote Proconsular Asia, a Roman province which
   embraced the western parts of Asia Minor, and of which Ephesus
   was the capital, in Acts 2:9; 6:9; 16:6; 19:10,22; 20:4, 16, 18,
   etc., and probably Asia Minor in Acts 19:26, 27; 21:27; 24:18;
   27:2. Proconsular Asia contained the seven churches of the
   Apocalypse (Rev. 1:11). The "chiefs of Asia" (Acts 19:31) were
   certain wealthy citizens who were annually elected to preside
   over the games and religious festivals of the several cities to
   which they belonged. Some of these "Asiarchs" were Paul's
   friends.
