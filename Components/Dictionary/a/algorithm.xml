      <WordDefinition>algorithm
     
        &lt;algorithm, programming&gt; A detailed sequence of actions to
        perform to accomplish some task.  Named after an Iranian
        mathematician, Al-Khawarizmi.
     
        Technically, an algorithm must reach a result after a {finite}
        number of steps, thus ruling out {brute force} search methods
        for certain problems, though some might claim that brute force
        search was also a valid (generic) algorithm.  The term is also
        used loosely for any sequence of actions (which may or may not
        terminate).
