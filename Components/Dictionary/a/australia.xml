   Introduction Australia
   ----------------------
                            Background: Australia became a commonwealth of
                                        the British Empire in 1901. It was
                                        able to take advantage of its
                                        natural resources to rapidly develop
                                        its agricultural and manufacturing
                                        industries and to make a major
                                        contribution to the British effort
                                        in World Wars I and II. Long-term
                                        concerns include pollution,
                                        particularly depletion of the ozone
                                        layer, and management and
                                        conservation of coastal areas,
                                        especially the Great Barrier Reef. A
                                        referendum to change Australia's
                                        status, from a commonwealth headed
                                        by the British monarch to an
                                        independent republic, was defeated
                                        in 1999.

   Economy Australia
   -----------------
                    Economy - overview: Australia has a prosperous Western-
                                        style capitalist economy, with a per
                                        capita GDP on par with the four
                                        dominant West European economies.
                                        The Australian economy has been
                                        resilient in the face of the global
                                        economic downturn in 2001 chalking
                                        up 2.3% GDP growth, as the domestic
                                        economy is offsetting the external
                                        slump and business and consumer
                                        confidence remains robust.
                                        Canberra's emphasis on reforms is a
                                        key factor behind the economy's
                                        strength, and Australia is expected
                                        to outperform its trading partners
                                        in 2002, with GDP growth projected
                                        to be 3% or better. Australia
                                        probably will experience some
                                        weakness in mid-2002 as its business
                                        cycle tends to lag the US by about
                                        six months, and larger problems
                                        could emerge if Australia's trade
                                        position worsens.
