      <WordDefinition>attribute
     
        &lt;data&gt; A named value or relationship that exists for some or
        all {instances} of some {entity} and is directly associated
        with that instance.
     
        Examples include the {href} attribute of an {HTML} {anchor}
        element, the columns of a database table considered as
        attributes of each row, and the {members} ({properties} and
        {methods} of an {object} in {OOP}.  This contrasts with the
        contents of some kind of container (e.g. an array), which are
        typically not named.  The contents of an {associative array},
        though they might be considered to be named by their key
        values, are not normally thought of as attributes.
