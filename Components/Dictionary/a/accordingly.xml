      <WordDefinition>Accordingly \Ac*cord"ing*ly\, adv.
   1. Agreeably; correspondingly; suitably; in a manner
      conformable.
      [1913 Webster]

            Behold, and so proceed accordingly.   --Shak.

   2. In natural sequence; consequently; so.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Consequently; therefore; wherefore; hence; so.

   Usage: {Accordingly}, {Consequently}, indicate a connection
          between two things, the latter of which is done on
          account of the former. Accordingly marks the
          connection as one of simple accordance or congruity,
          leading naturally to the result which followed; as, he
          was absent when I called, and I accordingly left my
          card; our preparations were all finished, and we
          accordingly set sail. Consequently all finished, and
          we accordingly set sail. Consequently marks a closer
          connection, that of logical or causal sequence; as,
          the papers were not ready, and consequently could not
          be signed.
