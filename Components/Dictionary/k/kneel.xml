      <WordDefinition>Kneel \Kneel\ (n[=e]l), v. i. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Knelt} (n[e^]lt) or
   {Kneeled} (n[=e]ld); p. pr. &amp; vb. n. {Kneeling}.] [OE.
   knelen, cneolien; akin to D. knielen, Dan. kn[ae]le. See
   {Knee}.]
   To bend the knee; to fall or rest on the knees; -- sometimes
   with down.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The act of kneeling, when performed in front of a
         person, is often done as a sign of respect, humility,
         or supplication. It has a similar significance when
         performed in front of religious objects, such as an
         altar or shrine.
         [PJC]

               And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice,
               Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. --Acts
                                                  vii. 60.
         [1913 Webster]

               As soon as you are dressed, kneel and say the
               Lord's Prayer.                     --Jer. Taylor.
         [1913 Webster]
