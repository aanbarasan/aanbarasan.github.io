      <WordDefinition>ken /ken/ n. 1. [Unix] Ken Thompson, principal inventor of Unix. In the
   early days he used to hand-cut distribution tapes, often with a note
   that read "Love, ken". Old-timers still use his first name (sometimes
   uncapitalized, because it's a login name and mail address) in
   third-person reference; it is widely understood (on Usenet, in
   particular) that without a last name `Ken' refers only to Ken Thompson.
   Similarly, Dennis without last name means Dennis Ritchie (and he is
   often known as dmr). See also {demigod}, {{Unix}}. 2. A flaming user.
   This was originated by the Software Support group at Symbolics because
   the two greatest flamers in the user community were both named Ken.
