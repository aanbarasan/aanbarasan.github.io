        &lt;communications&gt; A popular {packet-oriented} {protocol} from
        {Columbia University} for transferring {text files} and
        {binary files} on both {full-duplex} and {half-duplex} 8 bit
        and 7-bit serial connections in a system- and
        medium-independent fashion, and implemented on hundreds of
        different computer and {operating system} {platforms}.  On
        full-duplex connections a {sliding window} protocol with
        selective retransmission provides excellent performance and
        error recovery characteristics.  On 7-bit connections, locking
        shifts provide efficient transfer of 8-bit data.
     
        When properly implemented, as in the Columbia University
        Kermit Software collection, performance is equal to or better
        than other protocols such as {ZMODEM}, {YMODEM}, and {XMODEM},
        especially on poor connections.
     
        Kermit is an open protocol - anybody can base their own
        program on it, but some Kermit software and {source code} is
        {copyright} by Columbia University.
