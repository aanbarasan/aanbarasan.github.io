      <WordDefinition>knowledge
     
        &lt;artificial intelligence, information science&gt; The objects,
        concepts and relationships that are assumed to exist in some
        area of interest.  A collection of {knowledge}, represented
        using some {knowledge representation} language is known as a
        {knowledge base} and a program for extending and/or querying a
        knowledge base is a {knowledge-based system}.
     
        Knowledge differs from {data} or {information} in that new
        knowledge may be created from existing knowledge using logical
        {inference}.  If information is data plus meaning then
        knowledge is information plus processing.
     
        A common form of knowledge, e.g. in a {Prolog} program, is a
        collection of {fact}s and {rule}s about some subject.
     
        For example, a {knowledge base} about a family might contain
        the facts that John is David's son and Tom is John's son and
        the rule that the son of someone's son is their grandson.
        From this knowledge it could infer the new fact that Tom is
        David's grandson.
     
        See also {Knowledge Level}.

      <WordDefinition>Knowledge \Knowl"edge\, n. [OE. knowlage, knowlege, knowleche,
   knawleche. The last part is the Icel. suffix -leikr, forming
   abstract nouns, orig. the same as Icel. leikr game, play,
   sport, akin to AS. l[=a]c, Goth. laiks dance. See {Know}, and
   cf. {Lake}, v. i., {Lark} a frolic.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. The act or state of knowing; clear perception of fact,
      truth, or duty; certain apprehension; familiar cognizance;
      cognition.
      [1913 Webster]

            Knowledge, which is the highest degree of the
            speculative faculties, consists in the perception of
            the truth of affirmative or negative propositions.
                                                  --Locke.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. That which is or may be known; the object of an act of
      knowing; a cognition; -- chiefly used in the plural.
      [1913 Webster]

            There is a great difference in the delivery of the
            mathematics, which are the most abstracted of
            knowledges.                           --Bacon.
      [1913 Webster]

            Knowledges is a term in frequent use by Bacon, and,
            though now obsolete, should be revived, as without
            it we are compelled to borrow ``cognitions'' to
            express its import.                   --Sir W.
                                                  Hamilton.
      [1913 Webster]

            To use a word of Bacon's, now unfortunately
            obsolete, we must determine the relative value of
            knowledges.                           --H. Spencer.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. That which is gained and preserved by knowing;
      instruction; acquaintance; enlightenment; learning;
      scholarship; erudition.
      [1913 Webster]

            Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. --1 Cor.
                                                  viii. 1.
      [1913 Webster]

            Ignorance is the curse of God;
            Knowledge, the wing wherewith we fly to heaven.
                                                  --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. That familiarity which is gained by actual experience;
      practical skill; as, a knowledge of life.
      [1913 Webster]

            Shipmen that had knowledge of the sea. --1 Kings ix.
                                                  27.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. Scope of information; cognizance; notice; as, it has not
      come to my knowledge.
      [1913 Webster]

            Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou
            shouldst take knowledge of me?        --Ruth ii. 10.
      [1913 Webster]

   6. Sexual intercourse; -- usually preceded by carnal; same as
      {carnal knowledge}.

   Syn: See {Wisdom}.
