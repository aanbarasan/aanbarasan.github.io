      <WordDefinition>Kill \Kill\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Killed} (k[i^]ld); p. pr. &amp;

      slay.

      tediousness.

   Syn: To murder; assassinate; slay; butcher; destroy. -- To
        {Kill}, {Murder}, {Assassinate}. To kill does not
        necessarily mean any more than to deprive of life. A man
        may kill another by accident or in self-defense, without
        the imputation of guilt. To murder is to kill with
        malicious forethought and intention. To assassinate is
        to murder suddenly and by stealth. The sheriff may kill
        without murdering; the duelist murders, but does not
        assassinate his antagonist; the assassin kills and
        murders.
