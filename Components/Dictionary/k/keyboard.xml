      <WordDefinition>keyboard
     
        &lt;hardware&gt; A {hardware} device consisting of a number of
        mechanical buttons (keys) which the user presses to input
        characters to a computer.
     
        Keyboards were originally part of {terminals} which were
        separate {peripheral} devices that performed both input and
        output and communicated with the computer via a {serial line}.
        Today a keyboard is more likely to be connected more directly
        to the processor, allowing the processor to scan it and detect
        which key or keys are currently pressed.  Pressing a key sends
        a low-level {key code} to the keyboard input driver routine
        which translates this to one or more {characters} or special
        actions.
     
        Keyboards vary in the keys they have, most have keys to
        generate the {ASCII} {character set} as well as various
        {function keys} and special purpose keys, e.g. reset or volume
        control.
