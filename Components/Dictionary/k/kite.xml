      <WordDefinition>Kite
   an unclean and keen-sighted bird of prey (Lev. 11:14; Deut.
   14:13). The Hebrew word used, _'ayet_, is rendered "vulture" in
   Job 28:7 in Authorized Version, "falcon" in Revised Version. It
   is probably the red kite (Milvus regalis), a bird of piercing
   sight and of soaring habits found all over Palestine.
