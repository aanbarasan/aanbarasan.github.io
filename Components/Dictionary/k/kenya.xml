   Introduction Kenya
   ------------------
                            Background: Founding president and liberation
                                        struggle icon Jomo KENYATTA led
                                        Kenya from independence until his
                                        death in 1978, when current
                                        President Daniel Toroitich arap MOI
                                        took power in a constitutional
                                        succession. The country was a de
                                        facto one-party state from 1969
                                        until 1982 when the ruling Kenya
                                        African National Union (KANU) made
                                        itself the sole legal party in
                                        Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and
                                        external pressure for political
                                        liberalization in late 1991. The
                                        ethnically fractured opposition
                                        failed to dislodge KANU from power
                                        in elections in 1992 and 1997, which
                                        were marred by violence and fraud,
                                        but are viewed as having generally
                                        reflected the will of the Kenyan
                                        people. The country faces a period
                                        of political uncertainty because MOI
                                        is constitutionally required to step
                                        down at the next election that has
                                        to be held by early 2003.

   Economy Kenya
   -------------
                    Economy - overview: Kenya, the regional hub for trade
                                        and finance in East Africa, is
                                        hampered by corruption and reliance
                                        upon several primary goods whose
                                        prices continue to decline.
                                        Following strong economic growth in
                                        1995 and 1996, Kenya's economy has
                                        stagnated, with GDP growth failing
                                        to keep up with the rate of
                                        population growth. In 1997, the IMF
                                        suspended Kenya's Enhanced
                                        Structural Adjustment Program due to
                                        the government's failure to maintain
                                        reforms and curb corruption. A
                                        severe drought from 1999 to 2000
                                        compounded Kenya's problems, causing
                                        water and energy rationing and
                                        reducing agricultural output. As a
                                        result, GDP contracted by 0.3% in
                                        2000. The IMF, which had resumed
                                        loans in 2000 to help Kenya through
                                        the drought, again halted lending in
                                        2001 when the government failed to
                                        institute several anticorruption
                                        measures. Despite the return of
                                        strong rains in 2001, weak commodity
                                        prices, endemic corruption, and low
                                        investment limited Kenya's economic
                                        growth to 1%, and Kenya is unlikely
                                        to see growth above 2% in 2002.
                                        Substantial IMF and other foreign
                                        support is essential to prevent a
                                        further decline in real per capita
                                        output.
