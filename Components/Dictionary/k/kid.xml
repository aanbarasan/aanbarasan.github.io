      <WordDefinition>Kid
   the young of the goat. It was much used for food (Gen. 27:9;
   38:17; Judg. 6:19; 14:6). The Mosaic law forbade to dress a kid
   in the milk of its dam, a law which is thrice repeated (Ex.
   23:19; 34:26; Deut. 14:21). Among the various reasons assigned
   for this law, that appears to be the most satisfactory which
   regards it as "a protest against cruelty and outraging the order
   of nature." A kid cooked in its mother's milk is "a gross,
   unwholesome dish, and calculated to kindle animal and ferocious
   passions, and on this account Moses may have forbidden it.
   Besides, it is even yet associated with immoderate feasting; and
   originally, I suspect," says Dr. Thomson (Land and the Book),
   "was connected with idolatrous sacrifices."
