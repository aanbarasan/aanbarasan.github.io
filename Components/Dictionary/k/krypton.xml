Symbol: Kr
Atomic number: 36
Atomic weight: 83.80
Colorless gaseous element, belongs to the noble gases. Occurs in the air,
0.0001% by volume. It can be extracted from liquid air by fractional
distillation. Generally not isolated, but used with other inert gases in
fluorescent lamps. Five natural isotopes, and five radioactive isotopes.
Kr-85, the most stable radioactive isotope, has a half-life of 10.76
years and is produced in fission reactors. Practically inert, though known
to form compounds with {fluorine}.
