   Introduction Kazakhstan
   -----------------------
                            Background: Native Kazakhs, a mix of Turkic and
                                        Mongol nomadic tribes who migrated
                                        into the region in the 13th century,
                                        were rarely united as a single
                                        nation. The area was conquered by
                                        Russia in the 18th century and
                                        Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic
                                        in 1936. During the 1950s and 1960s
                                        agricultural "Virgin Lands" program,
                                        Soviet citizens were encouraged to
                                        help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern
                                        pastures. This influx of immigrants
                                        (mostly Russians, but also some
                                        other deported nationalities) skewed
                                        the ethnic mixture and enabled non-
                                        Kazakhs to outnumber natives.
                                        Independence has caused many of
                                        these newcomers to emigrate. Current
                                        issues include: developing a
                                        cohesive national identity;
                                        expanding the development of the
                                        country's vast energy resources and
                                        exporting them to world markets;
                                        achieving a sustainable economic
                                        growth outside the oil, gas, and
                                        mining sectors; and strengthening
                                        relations with neighboring states
                                        and other foreign powers.

   Economy Kazakhstan
   ------------------
                    Economy - overview: Kazakhstan, the largest of the
                                        former Soviet republics in
                                        territory, excluding Russia,
                                        possesses enormous fossil fuel
                                        reserves as well as plentiful
                                        supplies of other minerals and
                                        metals. It also is a large
                                        agricultural - livestock and grain -
                                        producer. Kazakhstan's industrial
                                        sector rests on the extraction and
                                        processing of these natural
                                        resources and also on a growing
                                        machine-building sector specializing
                                        in construction equipment, tractors,
                                        agricultural machinery, and some
                                        defense items. The breakup of the
                                        USSR in December 1991 and the
                                        collapse in demand for Kazakhstan's
                                        traditional heavy industry products
                                        resulted in a short-term contraction
                                        of the economy, with the steepest
                                        annual decline occurring in 1994. In
                                        1995-97, the pace of the government
                                        program of economic reform and
                                        privatization quickened, resulting
                                        in a substantial shifting of assets
                                        into the private sector. Kazakhstan
                                        has enjoyed double-digit growth in
                                        2000-01 thanks largely to its
                                        booming energy sector, but also to
                                        economic reform, good harvests, and
                                        foreign investment. The opening of
                                        the Caspian Consortium pipeline in
                                        2001, from western Kazakhstan's
                                        Tengiz oilfield to the Black Sea,
                                        substantially raises export
                                        capacity. Astana has embarked upon
                                        an industrial policy designed to
                                        diversify the economy away from
                                        overdependence on the oil sector by
                                        developing light industry.
