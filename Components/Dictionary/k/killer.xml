      <WordDefinition>Killer \Kill"er\, n.
   1. One who deprives of life; one who, or that which, kills.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Zo["o]l.) A voracious, toothed whale of the genus {Orca},
      of which several species are known; called also {killer
      whale}.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The killers have a high dorsal fin, and powerful jaws
         armed with large, sharp teeth. They capture, and
         swallow entire, large numbers of seals, porpoises, and
         dolphins, and are celebrated for their savage, combined
         attacks upon the right whales, which they are said to
         mutilate and kill. The common Atlantic species ({Orca
         gladiator}), is found both on the European and the
         American coast. Two species ({Orca ater} and {Orca
         rectipinna}) occur on the Pacific coast.
         [1913 Webster]
