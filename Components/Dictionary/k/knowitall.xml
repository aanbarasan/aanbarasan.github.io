      <WordDefinition>Know-it-all \Know"-it-all`\, n.
   One who knows everything; hence, a person who makes
   pretension to great knowledge, especially one whose didactic
   conversational habit conspicuously reveals his belief that he
   has superior knowledge on many subjects; a wiseacre; a
   know-all; -- usually ironical. [Colloq. &amp; pejorative]

   Note: the use of this term implies that the speaker
         disapproves of this behavior, and may think that it is
         unjustified
         [1913 Webster +PJC]
