      <WordDefinition>Brilliant \Bril"liant\, n. [F. brillant. See {Brilliant}, a.]
   1. A diamond or other gem of the finest cut, formed into
      faces and facets, so as to reflect and refract the light,
      by which it is rendered more brilliant. It has at the
      middle, or top, a principal face, called the table, which
      is surrounded by a number of sloping facets forming a
      bizet; below, it has a small face or collet, parallel to
      the table, connected with the girdle by a pavilion of
      elongated facets. It is thus distinguished from the rose
      diamond, which is entirely covered with facets on the
      surface, and is flat below.
