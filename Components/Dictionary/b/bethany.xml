      <WordDefinition>Bethany
   house of dates. (1.) The Revised Version in John 1:28 has this
   word instead of Bethabara, on the authority of the oldest
   manuscripts. It appears to have been the name of a place on the
   east of Jordan.
   
     (2.) A village on the south-eastern slope of the Mount of
   Olives (Mark 11:1), about 2 miles east of Jerusalem, on the road
   to Jericho. It derived its name from the number of palm-trees
   which grew there. It was the residence of Lazarus and his
   sisters. It is frequently mentioned in connection with memorable
   incidents in the life of our Lord (Matt. 21:17; 26:6; Mark
   11:11, 12; 14:3; Luke 24:50; John 11:1; 12:1). It is now known
   by the name of el-Azariyeh, i.e., "place of Lazarus," or simply
   Lazariyeh. Seen from a distance, the village has been described
   as "remarkably beautiful, the perfection of retirement and
   repose, of seclusion and lovely peace." Now a mean village,
   containing about twenty families.
