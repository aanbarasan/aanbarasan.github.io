      <WordDefinition>Bread
   among the Jews was generally made of wheat (Ex. 29:2; Judg.
   6:19), though also sometimes of other grains (Gen. 14:18; Judg.
   7:13). Parched grain was sometimes used for food without any
   other preparation (Ruth 2:14).
   
     Bread was prepared by kneading in wooden bowls or "kneading
   troughs" (Gen. 18:6; Ex. 12:34; Jer. 7:18). The dough was mixed
   with leaven and made into thin cakes, round or oval, and then
   baked. The bread eaten at the Passover was always unleavened
   (Ex. 12:15-20; Deut. 16:3). In the towns there were public
   ovens, which were much made use of for baking bread; there were
   also bakers by trade (Hos. 7:4; Jer. 37:21). Their ovens were
   not unlike those of modern times. But sometimes the bread was
   baked by being placed on the ground that had been heated by a
   fire, and by covering it with the embers (1 Kings 19:6). This
   was probably the mode in which Sarah prepared bread on the
   occasion referred to in Gen. 18:6.
   
     In Lev. 2 there is an account of the different kinds of bread
   and cakes used by the Jews. (See {BAKE}.)
   
     The shew-bread (q.v.) consisted of twelve loaves of unleavened
   bread prepared and presented hot on the golden table every
   Sabbath. They were square or oblong, and represented the twelve
   tribes of Israel. The old loaves were removed every Sabbath, and
   were to be eaten only by the priests in the court of the
   sanctuary (Ex. 25:30; Lev. 24:8; 1 Sam. 21:1-6; Matt. 12:4).
   
     The word bread is used figuratively in such expressions as
   "bread of sorrows" (Ps. 127:2), "bread of tears" (80:5), i.e.,
   sorrow and tears are like one's daily bread, they form so great
   a part in life. The bread of "wickedness" (Prov. 4:17) and "of
   deceit" (20:17) denote in like manner that wickedness and deceit
   are a part of the daily life.

   1. An article of food made from flour or meal by moistening,
      kneading, and baking.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note:

   {Raised bread} is made with yeast, salt, and sometimes a
      little butter or lard, and is mixed with warm milk or
      water to form the dough, which, after kneading, is given
      time to rise before baking.

   {Cream of tartar bread} is raised by the action of an
      alkaline carbonate or bicarbonate (as saleratus or
      ammonium bicarbonate) and cream of tartar (acid tartrate
      of potassium) or some acid.

   {Unleavened bread} is usually mixed with water and salt only.
