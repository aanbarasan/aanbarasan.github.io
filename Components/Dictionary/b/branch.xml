      <WordDefinition>Branch
   a symbol of kings descended from royal ancestors (Ezek. 17:3,
   10; Dan. 11:7); of prosperity (Job 8:16); of the Messiah, a
   branch out of the root of the stem of Jesse (Isa. 11:1), the
   "beautiful branch" (4:2), a "righteous branch" (Jer. 23:5), "the
   Branch" (Zech. 3:8; 6:12).
   
     Disciples are branches of the true vine (John 15:5, 6). "The
   branch of the terrible ones" (Isa. 25:5) is rightly translated
   in the Revised Version "the song of the terrible ones," i.e.,
   the song of victory shall be brought low by the destruction of
   Babylon and the return of the Jews from captivity.
   
     The "abominable branch" is a tree on which a malefactor has
   been hanged (Isa. 14:19). The "highest branch" in Ezek. 17:3
   represents Jehoiakim the king.
