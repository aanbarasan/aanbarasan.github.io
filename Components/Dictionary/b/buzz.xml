      <WordDefinition>buzz
     
        1. Of a program, to run with no indication of progress and
        perhaps without guarantee of ever finishing; especially said
        of programs thought to be executing a {tight loop} of code.  A
        program that is buzzing appears to be {catatonic}, but never
        gets out of catatonia, while a buzzing loop may eventually end
        of its own accord.  "The program buzzes for about 10 seconds
        trying to sort all the names into order."  See {spin}; see
        also {grovel}.
     
        2. [ETA Systems] To test a wire or printed circuit trace for
        continuity by applying an AC rather than DC signal.  Some wire
        faults will pass DC tests but fail a buzz test.
     
        3. To process an {array} or list in sequence, doing the same
        thing to each element.  "This loop buzzes through the tz array
        looking for a terminator type."
