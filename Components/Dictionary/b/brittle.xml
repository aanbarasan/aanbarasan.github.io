      <WordDefinition>brittle
     
        &lt;jargon&gt; Said of {software} that is functional but easily
        broken by changes in operating environment or configuration,
        or by any minor tweak to the software itself.  Also, any
        system that responds inappropriately and disastrously to
        abnormal but expected external stimuli; e.g. a {file system}
        that is usually totally scrambled by a power failure is said
        to be brittle.  This term is often used to describe the
        results of a research effort that were never intended to be
        robust, but it can be applied to commercially developed
        software, which displays the quality far more often than it
        ought to.
     
        Opposite of {robust}.

      <WordDefinition>brittle adj. Said of software that is functional but easily broken by
   changes in operating environment or configuration, or by any minor tweak
   to the software itself. Also, any system that responds inappropriately
   and disastrously to abnormal but expected external stimuli; e.g., a file
   system that is usually totally scrambled by a power failure is said to
   be brittle. This term is often used to describe the results of a
   research effort that were never intended to be robust, but it can be
   applied to commercial software, which (due to closed-source development)
   displays the quality far more often than it ought to. Oppose {robust}.
