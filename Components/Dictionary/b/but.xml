      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: {But}, {However}, {Still}.

   Usage: These conjunctions mark opposition in passing from one
          thought or topic to another. But marks the opposition
          with a medium degree of strength; as, this is not
          winter, but it is almost as cold; he requested my
          assistance, but I shall not aid him at present.
          However is weaker, and throws the opposition (as it
          were) into the background; as, this is not winter; it
          is, however, almost as cold; he required my
          assistance; at present, however, I shall not afford
          him aid. The plan, however, is still under
          consideration, and may yet be adopted. Still is
          stronger than but, and marks the opposition more
          emphatically; as, your arguments are weighty; still
          they do not convince me. See {Except}, {However}.
          [1913 Webster]

   Note: ``The chief error with but is to use it where and is
         enough; an error springing from the tendency to use
         strong words without sufficient occasion.'' --Bain.
