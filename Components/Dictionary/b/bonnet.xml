      <WordDefinition>Bonnet
   (Heb. peer), Ex. 39:28 (R.V., "head-tires"); Ezek. 44:18 (R.V.,
   "tires"), denotes properly a turban worn by priests, and in Isa.
   3:20 (R.V., "head-tires") a head-dress or tiara worn by females.
   The Hebrew word so rendered literally means an ornament, as in
   Isa. 61:10 (R.V., "garland"), and in Ezek. 24:17, 23 "tire"
   (R.V., "head-tire"). It consisted of a piece of cloth twisted
   about the head. In Ex. 28:40; 29:9 it is the translation of a
   different Hebrew word (migba'ah), which denotes the turban
   (R.V., "head-tire") of the common priest as distinguished from
   the mitre of the high priest. (See {MITRE}.)
