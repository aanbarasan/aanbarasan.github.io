      <WordDefinition>Badger
   this word is found in Ex. 25:5; 26:14; 35:7, 23; 36:19; 39:34;
   Num. 4:6, etc. The tabernacle was covered with badgers' skins;
   the shoes of women were also made of them (Ezek. 16:10). Our
   translators seem to have been misled by the similarity in sound
   of the Hebrew _tachash_ and the Latin _taxus_, "a badger." The
   revisers have correctly substituted "seal skins." The Arabs of
   the Sinaitic peninsula apply the name _tucash_ to the seals and
   dugongs which are common in the Red Sea, and the skins of which
   are largely used as leather and for sandals. Though the badger
   is common in Palestine, and might occur in the wilderness, its
   small hide would have been useless as a tent covering. The
   dugong, very plentiful in the shallow waters on the shores of
   the Red Sea, is a marine animal from 12 to 30 feet long,
   something between a whale and a seal, never leaving the water,
   but very easily caught. It grazes on seaweed, and is known by
   naturalists as Halicore tabernaculi.
