      <WordDefinition>Beyond
   when used with reference to Jordan, signifies in the writings of
   Moses the west side of the river, as he wrote on the east bank
   (Gen. 50:10, 11; Deut. 1:1, 5; 3:8, 20; 4:46); but in the
   writings of Joshua, after he had crossed the river, it means the
   east side (Josh. 5:1; 12:7; 22:7).
