      <WordDefinition>bingo \bingo\ n.
   a game commonly used for low-stakes gambling, in which
   numbered balls or slips are drawn at random and players cover
   the correponding numbers on their cards, called Bingo cards,
   which have square arrangement of such numbers. Each card has
   a different arrangement of the numbers, and the first player
   to cover all numbers in one row (horizontal, vertical, or
   diagonal) is the winner, usually announcing that fact by a
   cry of ``Bingo!''

   Note: Variants of the game may require that all peripheral
         numbers are covered, to form a box, or other figure.
         The numbers usually have one letter from the group
         ``B'', ``I'', ``N'', ``G'', and ``O'', plus two digits.
         The ``cards'' may be disposable sheets of paper on
         which the numbers are printed.

   Syn: lotto, beano, keno.
