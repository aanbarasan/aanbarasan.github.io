      <WordDefinition>broadband
     
        &lt;communications&gt; A transmission medium capable of supporting a
        wide range of frequencies, typically from audio up to video
        frequencies.  It can carry multiple signals by dividing the
        total capacity of the medium into multiple, independent
        bandwidth channels, where each channel operates only on a
        specific range of frequencies.
     
        See also {baseband}.
