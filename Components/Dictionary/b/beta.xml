        Nygaard, 1983.  Object-oriented language with block structure,
        coroutines, concurrency, {strong typing}, part objects,
        separate objects and classless objects.  Central feature is a
        single abstraction mechanism called "patterns", a
        generalisation of classes, providing instantiation and
        hierarchical inheritance for all objects including procedures
        and processes.

      <WordDefinition>Beta \Be"ta\, n. [Gr. bh^ta.]
   The second letter of the Greek alphabet, B, [beta]. See {B},
   and cf. etymology of {Alphabet}.

   Note: Beta (B, [beta]) is used variously for classifying, as:
   (a) (Astron.) To designate some bright star, usually the
       second brightest, of a constellation, as, [beta]
       Aurig[ae].
   (b) (Chem.) To distinguish one of two or more isomers; also,
       to indicate the position of substituting atoms or groups
       in certain compounds; as, [beta]-naphthol. With acids, it
       commonly indicates that the substituent is in union with
       the carbon atom next to that to which the carboxyl group
       is attached.

      <WordDefinition>beta /bay't*/, /be't*/ or (Commonwealth) /bee't*/ n.1. Mostly working,
   but still under test; usu. used with `in': `in beta'. In the {Real
   World}, hardware or software systems often go through two stages of
   release testing: Alpha (in-house) and Beta (out-house?). Beta releases
   are generally made to a group of lucky (or unlucky) trusted customers.
   2. Anything that is new and experimental. "His girlfriend is in beta"
   means that he is still testing for compatibility and reserving judgment.
   3. Flaky; dubious; suspect (since beta software is notoriously buggy).

   Historical note: More formally, to beta-test is to test a pre-release
   (potentially unreliable) version of a piece of software by making it
   available to selected (or self-selected) customers and users. This term
   derives from early 1960s terminology for product cycle checkpoints,
   first used at IBM but later standard throughout the industry. `Alpha
   Test' was the unit, module, or component test phase; `Beta Test' was
   initial system test. These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests
   for hardware. The A-test was a feasibility and manufacturability
   evaluation done before any commitment to design and development. The
   B-test was a demonstration that the engineering model functioned as
   specified. The C-test (corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test
   performed on early samples of the production design, and the D test was
   the C test repeated after the model had been in production a while.
