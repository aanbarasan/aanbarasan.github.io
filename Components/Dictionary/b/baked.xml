      <WordDefinition>Bake \Bake\ (b[=a]k), v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Baked} (b[=a]kt); p.
   pr. &amp; vb. n. {Baking}.] [AS. bacan; akin to D. bakken, OHG.

   to roast.]
   1. To prepare, as food, by cooking in a dry heat, either in
      an oven or under coals, or on heated stone or metal; as,
      to bake bread, meat, apples.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Baking is the term usually applied to that method of
         cooking which exhausts the moisture in food more than
         roasting or broiling; but the distinction of meaning
         between roasting and baking is not always observed.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. To dry or harden (anything) by subjecting to heat, as, to
      bake bricks; the sun bakes the ground.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. To harden by cold.
      [1913 Webster]

            The earth . . . is baked with frost.  --Shak.
