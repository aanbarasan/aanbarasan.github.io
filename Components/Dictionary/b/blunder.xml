   1. Confusion; disturbance. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

   2. A gross error or mistake, resulting from carelessness,
      stupidity, or culpable ignorance.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: {Blunder}, {Error}, {Mistake}, {Bull}.

   Usage: An error is a departure or deviation from that which
          is right or correct; as, an error of the press; an
          error of judgment. A mistake is the interchange or
          taking of one thing for another, through haste,
          inadvertence, etc.; as, a careless mistake. A blunder
          is a mistake or error of a gross kind. It supposes a
          person to flounder on in his course, from
          carelessness, ignorance, or stupidity. A bull is a
          verbal blunder containing a laughable incongruity of
          ideas.
