      <WordDefinition>Bee
   First mentioned in Deut. 1:44. Swarms of bees, and the danger of
   their attacks, are mentioned in Ps. 118:12. Samson found a
   "swarm of bees" in the carcass of a lion he had slain (Judg.
   14:8). Wild bees are described as laying up honey in woods and
   in clefts of rocks (Deut. 32:13; Ps. 81:16). In Isa. 7:18 the
   "fly" and the "bee" are personifications of the Egyptians and
   Assyrians, the inveterate enemies of Israel.

   Note: There are many genera and species. The common honeybee

         of honeybees, as the {Apis ligustica} of Spain and
