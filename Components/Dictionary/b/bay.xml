      <WordDefinition>Bay
   denotes the estuary of the Dead Sea at the mouth of the Jordan
   (Josh. 15:5; 18:19), also the southern extremity of the same sea
   (15:2). The same Hebrew word is rendered "tongue" in Isa. 11:15,
   where it is used with reference to the forked mouths of the
   Nile.
   
     Bay in Zech. 6:3, 7 denotes the colour of horses, but the
   original Hebrew means strong, and is here used rather to
   describe the horses as fleet or spirited.
