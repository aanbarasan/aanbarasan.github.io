      <WordDefinition>Bethel
   house of God. (1.) A place in Central Palestine, about 10 miles
   north of Jerusalem, at the head of the pass of Michmash and Ai.
   It was originally the royal Canaanite city of Luz (Gen. 28:19).
   The name Bethel was at first apparently given to the sanctuary
   in the neighbourhood of Luz, and was not given to the city
   itself till after its conquest by the tribe of Ephraim. When
   Abram entered Canaan he formed his second encampment between
   Bethel and Hai (Gen. 12:8); and on his return from Egypt he came
   back to it, and again "called upon the name of the Lord" (13:4).
   Here Jacob, on his way from Beersheba to Haran, had a vision of
   the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose
   top reached unto heaven (28:10, 19); and on his return he again
   visited this place, "where God talked with him" (35:1-15), and
   there he "built an altar, and called the place El-beth-el"
   (q.v.). To this second occasion of God's speaking with Jacob at
   Bethel, Hosea (12:4,5) makes reference.
   
     In troublous times the people went to Bethel to ask counsel of
   God (Judg. 20:18, 31; 21:2). Here the ark of the covenant was
   kept for a long time under the care of Phinehas, the grandson of
   Aaron (20:26-28). Here also Samuel held in rotation his court of
   justice (1 Sam. 7:16). It was included in Israel after the
   kingdom was divided, and it became one of the seats of the
   worship of the golden calf (1 Kings 12:28-33; 13:1). Hence the
   prophet Hosea (Hos. 4:15; 5:8; 10:5, 8) calls it in contempt
   Beth-aven, i.e., "house of idols." Bethel remained an abode of
   priests even after the kingdom of Israel was desolated by the
   king of Assyria (2 Kings 17:28, 29). At length all traces of the
   idolatries were extirpated by Josiah, king of Judah (2 Kings
   23:15-18); and the place was still in existence after the
   Captivity (Ezra 2:28; Neh. 7:32). It has been identified with
   the ruins of Beitin, a small village amid extensive ruins some 9
   miles south of Shiloh.
   
     (2.) Mount Bethel was a hilly district near Bethel (Josh.
   16:1; 1 Sam. 13:2).
   
     (3.) A town in the south of Judah (Josh. 8:17; 12:16).
