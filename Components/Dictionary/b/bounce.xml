      <WordDefinition>bounce
     
        1. (Perhaps by analogy to a bouncing check) An {electronic
        mail} message that is undeliverable and returns an error
        notification (a "{bounce message}") to the sender is said to
        "bounce".
     
        2. To play volleyball.  The now-demolished {D. C. Power Lab}
        building used by the {Stanford AI Lab} in the 1970s had a
        volleyball court on the front lawn.  From 5 PM to 7 PM was the
        scheduled maintenance time for the computer, so every
        afternoon at 5 would come over the intercom the cry: "Now hear
        this: bounce, bounce!", followed by Brian McCune loudly
        bouncing a volleyball on the floor outside the offices of
        known volleyballers.
     
        3. To engage in sexual intercourse; probably from the
        expression "bouncing the mattress", but influenced by Roo's
        psychosexually loaded "Try bouncing me, Tigger!" from the
        "Winnie-the-Pooh" books.
     
        Compare {boink}.
     
        4. To casually reboot a system in order to clear up a
        transient problem.  Reported primarily among {VMS} users.
     
        5. (VM/CMS programmers) Automatic warm-start of a computer
        after an error.  "I logged on this morning and found it had
        bounced 7 times during the night"
     
        6. (IBM) To {power cycle} a peripheral in order to reset it.
