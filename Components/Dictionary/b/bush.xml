      <WordDefinition>Bush
   in which Jehovah appeared to Moses in the wilderness (Ex. 3:2;
   Acts 7:30). It is difficult to say what particular kind of plant
   or bush is here meant. Probably it was the mimosa or acacia. The
   words "in the bush" in Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37, mean "in the
   passage or paragraph on the bush;" i.e., in Ex. 3.

      <WordDefinition>Bush \Bush\ (b[.u]sh), n. [OE. bosch, busch, buysch, bosk, busk;
   akin to D. bosch, OHG. busc, G. busch, Icel. b[=u]skr,
   b[=u]ski, Dan. busk, Sw. buske, and also to LL. boscus,
   buscus, Pr. bosc, It. bosco, Sp. &amp; Pg. bosque, F. bois, OF.
   bos. Whether the LL. or G. form is the original is uncertain;

      [1913 Webster]

   Note: This was the original sense of the word, as in the
         Dutch bosch, a wood, and was so used by Chaucer. In
         this sense it is extensively used in the British
         colonies, especially at the Cape of Good Hope, and also
         in Australia and Canada; as, to live or settle in the
         bush.

   2. A shrub; esp., a shrub with branches rising from or near

            flowers.                              --Gascoigne.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. A shrub cut off, or a shrublike branch of a tree; as,
      bushes to support pea vines.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. A shrub or branch, properly, a branch of ivy (as sacred to
      Bacchus), hung out at vintners' doors, or as a tavern
      sign; hence, a tavern sign, and symbolically, the tavern
      itself.
      [1913 Webster]

            If it be true that good wine needs no bush, 't is
            true that a good play needs no epilogue. --Shak.
