      <WordDefinition>Brother
   (1.) In the natural and common sense (Matt. 1:2; Luke 3:1, 19).
   
     (2.) A near relation, a cousin (Gen. 13:8; 14:16; Matt. 12:46;
   John 7:3; Acts 1:14; Gal. 1:19).
   
     (3.) Simply a fellow-countryman (Matt. 5:47; Acts 3:22; Heb.
   7:5).
   
     (4.) A disciple or follower (Matt. 25:40; Heb. 2:11, 12).
   
     (5.) One of the same faith (Amos 1:9; Acts 9:30; 11:29; 1 Cor.
   5:11); whence the early disciples of our Lord were known to each
   other as brethren.
   
     (6.) A colleague in office (Ezra 3:2; 1 Cor. 1:1; 2 Cor. 1:1).
   
     (7.) A fellow-man (Gen. 9:5; 19:7; Matt. 5:22, 23, 24; 7:5;
   Heb. 2:17).
   
     (8.) One beloved or closely united with another in affection
   (2 Sam. 1:26; Acts 6:3; 1 Thess. 5:1). Brethren of Jesus (Matt.
   1:25; 12:46, 50: Mark 3:31, 32; Gal. 1:19; 1 Cor. 9:5, etc.)
   were probably the younger children of Joseph and Mary. Some have
   supposed that they may have been the children of Joseph by a
   former marriage, and others that they were the children of Mary,
   the Virgin's sister, and wife of Cleophas. The first
   interpretation, however, is the most natural.

   (br[u^][th]"[~e]rz) or {Brethren} (br[e^][th]"r[e^]n). See
   {Brethren}. [OE. brother, AS. br[=o][eth]or; akin to OS.
   brothar, D. broeder, OHG. pruodar, G. bruder, Icel.
   br[=o][eth]ir, Sw. &amp; Dan. broder, Goth. br[=o][thorn]ar, Ir.
   brathair, W. brawd, pl. brodyr, Lith. brolis, Lett. brahlis,
   Russ. brat', Pol. &amp; Serv. brat, OSlav. bratr[u^], L. frater,
   Skr. bhr[=a]t[.r], Zend bratar brother, Gr. fra`thr, fra`twr,
   a clansman. The common plural is {Brothers}; in the solemn
   style, {Brethren}, OE. pl. brether, bretheren, AS. dative
   sing. br[=e][eth]er, nom. pl. br[=o][eth]or, br[=o][eth]ru.
   [root]258. Cf. {Friar}, {Fraternal}.]
   1. A male person who has the same father and mother with
      another person, or who has one of them only. In the latter
      case he is more definitely called a {half brother}, or
      {brother of the half blood}.

   Note: A brother having the same mother but different fathers
         is called a {uterine brother}, and one having the same
         father but a different mother is called an {agnate
         brother}, or in (Law) a {consanguine brother}. A
         brother having the same father and mother is called a
         {brother-german} or {full brother}. The same modifying
         terms are applied to {sister} or {sibling}.
         [1913 Webster +PJC]

               Two of us in the churchyard lie,
               My sister and my brother.          --Wordsworth.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. One related or closely united to another by some common
      tie or interest, as of rank, profession, membership in a
      society, toil, suffering, etc.; -- used among judges,
      clergymen, monks, physicians, lawyers, professors of
      religion, etc. ``A brother of your order.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            We few, we happy few, we band of brothers,
            For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
            Shall be my brother.                  --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. One who, or that which, resembles another in distinctive
      qualities or traits of character.
      [1913 Webster]

            He also that is slothful in his work is brother to
            him that is a great waster.           --Prov. xviii.
                                                  9.
      [1913 Webster]

            That April morn
            Of this the very brother.             --Wordsworth.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In Scripture, the term brother is applied to a kinsman
         by blood more remote than a son of the same parents, as
         in the case of Abraham and Lot, Jacob and Laban. In a
         more general sense, brother or brethren is used for
         fellow-man or fellow-men.
         [1913 Webster]

               For of whom such massacre
               Make they but of their brethren, men of men?
                                                  --Milton.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Brother Jonathan}, a humorous designation for the people of
      the United States collectively. The phrase is said to have
      originated from Washington's referring to the patriotic
      Jonathan Trumbull, governor of Connecticut, as ``Brother
      Jonathan.''

   {Blood brother}. See under {Blood}.
