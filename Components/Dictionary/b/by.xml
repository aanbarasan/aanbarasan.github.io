      <WordDefinition>By \By\ (b[imac]), prep. [OE. bi, AS. b[=i], big, near to, by,
   of, from, after, according to; akin to OS. &amp; OFries. bi, be,

      aid of; through; through the act or agency of; as, a city
      is destroyed by fire; profit is made by commerce; to take
      by force.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: To the meaning of by, as denoting means or agency,
         belong, more or less closely, most of the following
         uses of the word:
      (a) It points out the author and producer; as,
          ``Waverley'', a novel by Sir W.Scott; a statue by
          Canova; a sonata by Beethoven.
      (b) In an oath or adjuration, it indicates the being or
          thing appealed to as sanction; as, I affirm to you by
          all that is sacred; he swears by his faith as a
          Christian; no, by Heaven.
      (c) According to; by direction, authority, or example of;
          after; -- in such phrases as, it appears by his
          account; ten o'clock by my watch; to live by rule; a
          model to build by.
      (d) At the rate of; according to the ratio or proportion
          of; in the measure or quantity of; as, to sell cloth
          by the yard, milk by the quart, eggs by the dozen,
          meat by the pound; to board by the year.
      (e) In comparison, it denotes the measure of excess or
          deficiency; when anything is increased or diminished,
          it indicates the measure of increase or diminution;
          as, larger by a half; older by five years; to lessen
          by a third.
      (f) It expresses continuance or duration; during the
          course of; within the period of; as, by day, by night.
      (g) As soon as; not later than; near or at; -- used in
          expressions of time; as, by this time the sun had
          risen; he will be here by two o'clock.
          [1913 Webster]

   Note: In boxing the compass, by indicates a pint nearer to,
         or towards, the next cardinal point; as, north by east,
         i.e., a point towards the east from the north;
         northeast by east, i.e., on point nearer the east than
         northeast is.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: With is used instead of by before the instrument with
         which anything is done; as, to beat one with a stick;
         the board was fastened by the carpenter with nails. But
         there are many words which may be regarded as means or
         processes, or, figuratively, as instruments; and
         whether with or by shall be used with them is a matter
         of arbitrary, and often, of unsettled usage; as, to a
         reduce a town by famine; to consume stubble with fire;
         he gained his purpose by flattery; he entertained them
         with a story; he distressed us with or by a recital of
         his sufferings. see {With}.
         [1913 Webster]

   {By all means}, most assuredly; without fail; certainly.

   {By and by}.
      (a) Close together (of place). [Obs.] ``Two yonge knightes
          liggyng [lying] by and by.'' --Chaucer.
      (b) Immediately; at once. [Obs.] ``When . . . persecution
          ariseth because of the word, by and by he is
          offended.'' --Matt. xiii. 21.
      (c) Presently; pretty soon; before long.

   Note: In this phrase, by seems to be used in the sense of
         nearness in time, and to be repeated for the sake of
         emphasis, and thus to be equivalent to ``soon, and
         soon,'' that is instantly; hence, -- less emphatically,
         -- pretty soon, presently.

   {By one's self}, with only one's self near; alone; solitary.

   {By the bye}. See under {Bye}.

   {By the head} (Naut.), having the bows lower than the stern;
      -- said of a vessel when her head is lower in the water
      than her stern. If her stern is lower, she is by the
      stern.

   {By the lee}, the situation of a vessel, going free, when she
      has fallen off so much as to bring the wind round her
      stern, and to take her sails aback on the other side.

   {By the run}, to let go by the run, to let go altogether,
      instead of slacking off.

   {By the way}, by the bye; -- used to introduce an incidental
      or secondary remark or subject. 

   {Day by day}, {One by one}, {Piece by piece}, etc., each day,
      each one, each piece, etc., by itself singly or
      separately; each severally.

   {To come by}, to get possession of; to obtain.

   {To do by}, to treat, to behave toward.

   {To set by}, to value, to esteem.

   {To stand by}, to aid, to support.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The common phrase good-by is equivalent to farewell,
         and would be better written good-bye, as it is a
         corruption of God be with you (b'w'ye).
         [1913 Webster]
