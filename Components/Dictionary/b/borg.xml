      <WordDefinition>Borg n. In "Star Trek: The Next Generation" the Borg is a species of
   cyborg that ruthlessly seeks to incorporate all sentient life into
   itself; their slogan is "You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile."
   In hacker parlance, the Borg is usually {Microsoft}, which is thought to
   be trying just as ruthlessly to assimilate all computers and the entire
   Internet to itself (there is a widely circulated image of Bill Gates as
   a Borg). Being forced to use Windows or NT is often referred to as being
   "Borged". Interestingly, the {Halloween Documents} reveal that this
   jargon is live within Microsoft itself. (Other companies, notably Intel
   and UUNet, have also occasionally been equated to the Borg.) See also
   {Evil Empire}, {Internet Exploiter}.

   In IETF circles, where direct pressure from Microsoft is not a daily
   reality, the Borg is sometimes Cisco. This usage commemmorates their
   tendency to pay any price to hire talent away from their competitors. In
   fact, at the Spring 1997 IETF, a large number of ex-Cisco employees, all
   former members of Routing Geeks, showed up with t-shirts printed with
   "Recovering Borg".
