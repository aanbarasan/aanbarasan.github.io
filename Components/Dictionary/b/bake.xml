      <WordDefinition>Bake
   The duty of preparing bread was usually, in ancient times,
   committed to the females or the slaves of the family (Gen. 18:6;
   Lev. 26:26; 1 Sam. 8:13); but at a later period we find a class
   of public bakers mentioned (Hos. 7:4, 6; Jer. 37:21).
   
     The bread was generally in the form of long or round cakes
   (Ex. 29:23; 1 Sam. 2:36), of a thinness that rendered them
   easily broken (Isa. 58:7; Matt. 14:19; 26:26; Acts 20:11).
   Common ovens were generally used; at other times a jar was
   half-filled with hot pebbles, and the dough was spread over
   them. Hence we read of "cakes baken on the coals" (1 Kings
   19:6), and "baken in the oven" (Lev. 2:4). (See {BREAD}.)

      <WordDefinition>Bake \Bake\ (b[=a]k), v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Baked} (b[=a]kt); p.
   pr. &amp; vb. n. {Baking}.] [AS. bacan; akin to D. bakken, OHG.

   1. To prepare, as food, by cooking in a dry heat, either in
      an oven or under coals, or on heated stone or metal; as,

   Note: Baking is the term usually applied to that method of
         cooking which exhausts the moisture in food more than
         roasting or broiling; but the distinction of meaning
         between roasting and baking is not always observed.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. To dry or harden (anything) by subjecting to heat, as, to
      bake bricks; the sun bakes the ground.
      [1913 Webster]
