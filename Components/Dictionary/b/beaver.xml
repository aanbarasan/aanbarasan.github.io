         valued for its fur, and for the material called
         {castor}, obtained from two small bags in the groin of
         the animal. The European species is {Castor fiber}, and
         the American is generally considered a variety of this,
         although sometimes called {Castor Canadensis}.

   4. Beaver cloth, a heavy felted woolen cloth, used chiefly
      for making overcoats.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. A man's beard.
      [PJC]

   6. The hair on a woman's pubic area; -- vulgar. [vulgar
      slang]
      [PJC]

   7. A woman; -- vulgar and offensive. [vulgar slang]
      [PJC]

   8. A person who works enthusiastically and diligently; --
      used especially in the phrase {eager beaver}. [informal]
      [PJC]
