      <WordDefinition>bomb
     
        1. &lt;software&gt; General synonym for {crash} except that it is
        not used as a noun.  Especially used of software or {OS}
        failures.  "Don't run Empire with less than 32K stack, it'll
        bomb".
     
        2. &lt;operating system&gt; {Atari ST} and {Macintosh} equivalents
        of a {Unix} "{panic}" or {Amiga} {guru}, in which {icon}s of
        little black-powder bombs or mushroom clouds are displayed,
        indicating that the system has died.  On the {Macintosh}, this
        may be accompanied by a decimal (or occasionally
        {hexadecimal}) number indicating what went wrong, similar to
        the {Amiga} {guru meditation} number.  {MS-DOS} computers tend
        to {lock up} in this situation.
     
        3. &lt;software&gt; A piece of code embedded in a program that
        remains dormant until it is triggered.  Logic bombs are
        triggered by an event whereas time bombs are triggered either
        after a set amount of time has elapsed, or when a specific
        date is reached.
