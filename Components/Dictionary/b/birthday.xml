      <WordDefinition>Birth-day
   The observance of birth-days was common in early times (Job 1:4,
   13, 18). They were specially celebrated in the land of Egypt
   (Gen. 40:20). There is no recorded instance in Scripture of the
   celebration of birth-days among the Jews. On the occasion of
   Herod's birth-day John the Baptist was beheaded (Matt. 14:6).
