   Introduction Brazil
   -------------------
                            Background: Following three centuries under the
                                        rule of Portugal, Brazil became an
                                        independent nation in 1822. By far
                                        the largest and most populous
                                        country in South America, Brazil has
                                        overcome more than half a century of
                                        military intervention in the
                                        governance of the country to pursue
                                        industrial and agricultural growth
                                        and development of the interior.
                                        Exploiting vast natural resources
                                        and a large labor pool, Brazil
                                        became South America's leading
                                        economic power by the 1970s. Highly
                                        unequal income distribution remains
                                        a pressing problem.

   People Brazil
   -------------
                            Population: 176,029,560
                                        note: Brazil took an intercensal
                                        count in August 1996 which reported
                                        a population of 157,079,573; that
                                        figure was about 5% lower than
                                        projections by the US Census Bureau,
                                        which is close to the implied
                                        underenumeration of 4.6% for the
                                        1991 census; estimates for this
                                        country explicitly take into account
                                        the effects of excess mortality due
                                        to AIDS; this can result in lower
                                        life expectancy, higher infant
                                        mortality and death rates, lower
                                        population and growth rates, and
                                        changes in the distribution of

                                        otherwise be expected (July 2002

                                        expanding its presence in world
                                        markets. The maintenance of large
                                        current account deficits via capital
                                        account surpluses became problematic
                                        as investors became more risk averse
                                        to emerging market exposure as a
                                        consequence of the Asian financial
                                        crisis in 1997 and the Russian bond
                                        default in August 1998. After
                                        crafting a fiscal adjustment program
                                        and pledging progress on structural
                                        reform, Brazil received a $41.5
                                        billion IMF-led international
                                        support program in November 1998. In
                                        January 1999, the Brazilian Central
                                        Bank announced that the real would
                                        no longer be pegged to the US
                                        dollar. This devaluation helped
                                        moderate the downturn in economic
                                        growth in 1999 that investors had
                                        expressed concerns about over the
                                        summer of 1998, and the country
                                        posted moderate GDP growth. Economic
                                        growth slowed considerably in 2001 -
                                        to less than 2% - because of a
                                        slowdown in major markets and the
                                        hiking of interest rates by the
                                        Central Bank to combat inflationary
                                        pressures. Investor confidence was
                                        strong at yearend 2001, in part
                                        because of the strong recovery in
                                        the trade balance.
