      <WordDefinition>Because \Be*cause"\, conj. [OE. bycause; by + cause.]
   1. By or for the cause that; on this account that; for the
      reason that. --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. In order that; that. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

            And the multitude rebuked them because they should
            hold their peace.                     --Matt. xx.
                                                  31.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Because of}, by reason of, on account of. [Prep. phrase.]
      [1913 Webster]

            Because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon
            the children of disobedience.         --Eph. v. 6.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: {Because}, {For}, {Since}, {As}, {Inasmuch As}.

   Usage: These particles are used, in certain connections, to
          assign the reason of a thing, or that ``on account
          of'' which it is or takes place. Because (by cause) is
          the strongest and most emphatic; as, I hid myself
          because I was afraid. For is not quite so strong; as,
          in Shakespeare, ``I hate him, for he is a Christian.''
          Since is less formal and more incidental than because;
          as, I will do it since you request me. It more
          commonly begins a sentence; as, Since your decision is
          made, I will say no more. As is still more incidental
          than since, and points to some existing fact by way of
          assigning a reason. Thus we say, as I knew him to be
          out of town, I did not call. Inasmuch as seems to
          carry with it a kind of qualification which does not
          belong to the rest. Thus, if we say, I am ready to
          accept your proposal, inasmuch as I believe it is the
          best you can offer, we mean, it is only with this
          understanding that we can accept it.
          [1913 Webster] ||
