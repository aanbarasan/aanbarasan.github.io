      <WordDefinition>Bigamy \Big"a*my\, n. [OE. bigamie, fr. L. bigamus twice
   married; bis twice + Gr. ? marriage; prob. akin to Skt.
   j[=a]mis related, and L. gemini twins, the root meaning to
   bind, join: cf. F. bigamie. Cf. {Digamy}.] (Law)
   The offense of marrying one person when already legally
   married to another. --Wharton.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: It is not strictly correct to call this offense bigamy:
         it more properly denominated polygamy, i. e., having a
         plurality of wives or husbands at once, and in several
         statutes in the United States the offense is classed
         under the head of polygamy.
         In the canon law bigamy was the marrying of two virgins
         successively, or one after the death of the other, or
         once marrying a widow. This disqualified a man for
         orders, and for holding ecclesiastical offices.
         Shakespeare uses the word in the latter sense.
         --Blackstone. --Bouvier.
         [1913 Webster]

               Base declension and loathed bigamy. --Shak.
