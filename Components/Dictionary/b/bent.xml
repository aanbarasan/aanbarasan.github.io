   Usage: {Bent}, {Bias}, {Inclination}, {Prepossession}. These
          words agree in describing a permanent influence upon
          the mind which tends to decide its actions. Bent
          denotes a fixed tendency of the mind in a given
          direction. It is the widest of these terms, and
          applies to the will, the intellect, and the
          affections, taken conjointly; as, the whole bent of
          his character was toward evil practices. Bias is
          literally a weight fixed on one side of a ball used in
          bowling, and causing it to swerve from a straight
          course. Used figuratively, bias applies particularly
          to the judgment, and denotes something which acts with
          a permanent force on the character through that
          faculty; as, the bias of early education, early
          habits, etc. Inclination is an excited state of desire
          or appetency; as, a strong inclination to the study of
          the law. Prepossession is a mingled state of feeling
          and opinion in respect to some person or subject,
          which has laid hold of and occupied the mind previous
          to inquiry. The word is commonly used in a good sense,
          an unfavorable impression of this kind being
          denominated a prejudice. ``Strong minds will be
          strongly bent, and usually labor under a strong bias;
          but there is no mind so weak and powerless as not to
          have its inclinations, and none so guarded as to be
          without its prepossessions.'' --Crabb.
