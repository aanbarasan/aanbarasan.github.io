      <WordDefinition>Bear
   a native of the mountain regions of Western Asia, frequently
   mentioned in Scripture. David defended his flocks against the
   attacks of a bear (1 Sam. 17:34-37). Bears came out of the wood
   and destroyed the children who mocked the prophet Elisha (2
   Kings 2:24). Their habits are referred to in Isa. 59:11; Prov.
   28:15; Lam. 3:10. The fury of the female bear when robbed of her
   young is spoken of (2 Sam. 17:8; Prov. 17:12; Hos. 13:8). In
   Daniel's vision of the four great monarchies, the Medo-Persian
   empire is represented by a bear (7:5).
