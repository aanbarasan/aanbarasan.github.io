      <WordDefinition>Bow
   The bow was in use in early times both in war and in the chase
   (Gen. 21:20; 27:3; 48:22). The tribe of Benjamin were famous for
   the use of the bow (1 Chr. 8:40; 12:2; 2 Chr. 14:8; 17:17); so
   also were the Elamites (Isa. 22:6) and the Lydians (Jer. 46:9).
   The Hebrew word commonly used for bow means properly to tread (1
   Chr. 5:18; 8:40), and hence it is concluded that the foot was
   employed in bending the bow. Bows of steel (correctly "copper")
   are mentioned (2 Sam. 22:35; Ps. 18:34).
   
     The arrows were carried in a quiver (Gen. 27:3; Isa. 22:6;
   49:2; Ps. 127:5). They were apparently sometimes shot with some
   burning material attached to them (Ps. 120:4).
   
     The bow is a symbol of victory (Ps. 7:12). It denotes also
   falsehood, deceit (Ps. 64:3, 4; Hos. 7:16; Jer. 9:3).
   
     "The use of the bow" in 2 Sam. 1:18 (A.V.) ought to be "the
   song of the bow," as in the Revised Version.
