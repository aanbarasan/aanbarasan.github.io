      <WordDefinition>bot
     
        &lt;networking, chat, World-Wide Web&gt; (From "{robot}") Any type
        of autonomous {software} that operates as an {agent} for a
        user or a {program} or simulates a human activity.  On the
        {Internet}, the most popular bots are programs (called
        {spiders} or crawlers) used for searching.  They access {web
        sites}, retrieve documents and follow all the {hyperlinks} in
        them; then they generate catalogs that are accessed by {search
        engines}.
     
        A {chatbot} converses with humans (or other bots).  A
        {shopbot} searches the Web to find the best price for a
        product.  Other bots (such as {OpenSesame}) observe a user's
        patterns in navigating a web site and customises the site for
        that user.
     
        {Knowbots} collect specific information from {web sites}.

      <WordDefinition>bot n [common on IRC, MUD and among gamers; from `robot'] 1. An {IRC}
   or {MUD} user who is actually a program. On IRC, typically the robot
   provides some useful service. Examples are NickServ, which tries to
   prevent random users from adopting {nick}s already claimed by others,
   and MsgServ, which allows one to send asynchronous messages to be
   delivered when the recipient signs on. Also common are `annoybots', such
   as KissServ, which perform no useful function except to send cute
   messages to other people. Service bots are less common on MUDs; but some
   others, such as the `Julia' bot active in 1990-91, have been remarkably
   impressive Turing-test experiments, able to pass as human for as long as
   ten or fifteen minutes of conversation. 2. An AI-controlled player in a
   computer game (especially a first-person shooter such as Quake) which,
   unlike ordinary monsters, operates like a human-controlled player, with
   access to a player's weapons and abilities. An example can be found at
   `http://www.telefragged.com/thefatal/'. 3. Term used, though less
   commonly, for a web {spider}. The file for controlling spider behavior
   on your site is officially the "Robots Exclusion File" and its URL is
   "http://&lt;somehost&gt;/robots.txt")

   Note that bots in all senses were `robots' when the terms first
   appeared in the early 1990s, but the shortened form is now habitual.
