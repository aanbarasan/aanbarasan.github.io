      <WordDefinition>background
     
        1. &lt;operating system&gt; A task running in the background (a
        background task) is detached from the terminal where it was
        started (and often running at a lower priority); opposite of
        {foreground}.  This means that the task's input and output
        must be from/to files (or other processes).
     
        Nowadays this term is primarily associated with {Unix}, but it
        appears to have been first used in this sense on {OS/360}.
     
        Compare {amp off}, {batch}, {slopsucker}.
     
        2. &lt;jargon&gt; For a human to do a task "in the background" is to
        do it whenever {foreground} matters are not claiming your
        undivided attention, and "to background" something means to
        relegate it to a lower priority.  "For now, we'll just print a
        list of nodes and links; I'm working on the graph-printing
        problem in the background."  Note that this implies ongoing
        activity but at a reduced level or in spare time, in contrast
        to mainstream "back burner" (which connotes benign neglect
        until some future resumption of activity).  Some people prefer
        to use the term for processing that they have queued up for
        their unconscious minds (often a fruitful tack to take upon
        encountering an obstacle in creative work).

   [1913 Webster]
   1. Ground in the rear or behind, or in the distance, as
      opposed to the {foreground}, or the ground in front.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Paint.) The space which is behind and subordinate to a
      portrait or group of figures.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The distance in a picture is usually divided into
         foreground, middle distance, and background.
         --Fairholt.
         [1913 Webster]

   3. Anything behind, serving as a foil; as, the statue had a
      background of red hangings.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. A place in obscurity or retirement, or out of sight.
      [1913 Webster]

            I fancy there was a background of grinding and
            waiting before Miss Torry could produce this highly
            finished . . . performance.           --Mrs.
                                                  Alexander.

   5. The set of conditions within which an action takes place,
      including the social and physical conditions as well as
      the psychological states of the participants; as, within
      the background of the massive budget deficits of the

      by the congress.
      [PJC]

   6. The set of conditions that precede and affect an action,
      such as the social and historical precedents for the
      event, as well as the general background[5]; as, against

      of Kosovars for vengeance is understandable though
      regrettable.

      Electronic noise present in a system using electronic
      measuring instrument or in a telecommunications system,
      which may hide and which must be differentiated from the
      desired signal; also called background noise or {noise}.
      [PJC]

   8. (Journalism) An agreement between a journalist and an
      interviewee that the name of the interviewee will not be
      quoted in any publication, although the substance of the
      remarks may be reported; -- often used in the phrase ``on
      background''. Compare {deep background}.
      [PJC]

   {To place in the background}, to make of little consequence.

   {To keep in the background}, to remain unobtrusive,
      inconspicuous or out of sight; -- of people.

   {deep background}, (Journalism) the status of an interview
      which must not be quoted in a publication, even without
      attribution. Compare {background}[8].

      <WordDefinition>background n.,adj.,vt. [common] To do a task `in background' is to do
   it whenever {foreground} matters are not claiming your undivided
   attention, and `to background' something means to relegate it to a lower
   priority. "For now, we'll just print a list of nodes and links; I'm
   working on the graph-printing problem in background." Note that this
   implies ongoing activity but at a reduced level or in spare time, in
   contrast to mainstream `back burner' (which connotes benign neglect
   until some future resumption of activity). Some people prefer to use the
   term for processing that they have queued up for their unconscious minds
   (a tack that one can often fruitfully take upon encountering an obstacle
   in creative work). Compare {amp off}, {slopsucker}.

   Technically, a task running in background is detached from the
   terminal where it was started (and often running at a lower priority);
   oppose {foreground}. Nowadays this term is primarily associated with
   {{Unix}}, but it appears to have been first used in this sense on
   OS/360.
