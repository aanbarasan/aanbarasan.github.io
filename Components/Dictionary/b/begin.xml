      <WordDefinition>\begin
     
        &lt;text, chat&gt; The {LaTeX} command used with \end to delimit an
        environment within which the text is formatted in a certain
        way.  E.g. \begin{table}...\end{table}.
     
        Used humorously in writing to indicate a context or to remark
        on the surrounded text.  For example:
     
         \begin{flame}
         Predicate logic is the only good programming
         language.  Anyone who would use anything else
         is an idiot.  Also, all computers should be
         tredecimal instead of binary.
         \end{flame}
     
        {Scribe} users at {CMU} and elsewhere used to use @Begin/@End
        in an identical way (LaTeX was built to resemble Scribe).  On
        {Usenet}, this construct would more frequently be rendered as
        "&lt;FLAME ON&gt;" and "&lt;FLAME OFF&gt;" (a la {HTML}), or "#ifdef
        FLAME" and "#endif FLAME" (a la {C preprocessor}).
