      <WordDefinition>Babylon
   the Greek form of BABEL; Semitic form Babilu, meaning "The Gate
   of God." In the Assyrian tablets it means "The city of the
   dispersion of the tribes." The monumental list of its kings
   reaches back to B.C. 2300, and includes Khammurabi, or Amraphel
   (q.v.), the contemporary of Abraham. It stood on the Euphrates,
   about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which flowed
   through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts.
   The Elamites invaded Chaldea (i.e., Lower Mesopotamia, or
   Shinar, and Upper Mesopotamia, or Accad, now combined into one)
   and held it in subjection. At length Khammu-rabi delivered it
   from the foreign yoke, and founded the new empire of Chaldea
   (q.v.), making Babylon the capital of the united kingdom. This
   city gradually grew in extent and grandeur, but in process of
   time it became subject to Assyria. On the fall of Nineveh (B.C.
   606) it threw off the Assyrian yoke, and became the capital of
   the growing Babylonian empire. Under Nebuchadnezzar it became
   one of the most splendid cities of the ancient world.
   
     After passing through various vicissitudes the city was
   occupied by Cyrus, "king of Elam," B.C. 538, who issued a decree
   permitting the Jews to return to their own land (Ezra 1). It
   then ceased to be the capital of an empire. It was again and
   again visited by hostile armies, till its inhabitants were all
   driven from their homes, and the city became a complete
   desolation, its very site being forgotten from among men.
   
     On the west bank of the Euphrates, about 50 miles south of
   Bagdad, there is found a series of artificial mounds of vast
   extent. These are the ruins of this once famous proud city.
   These ruins are principally (1) the great mound called Babil by
   the Arabs. This was probably the noted Temple of Belus, which
   was a pyramid about 480 feet high. (2) The Kasr (i.e., "the
   palace"). This was the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. It is
   almost a square, each side of which is about 700 feet long. The
   little town of Hillah, near the site of Babylon, is built almost
   wholly of bricks taken from this single mound. (3) A lofty
   mound, on the summit of which stands a modern tomb called Amran
   ibn-Ali. This is probably the most ancient portion of the
   remains of the city, and represents the ruins of the famous
   hanging-gardens, or perhaps of some royal palace. The utter
   desolation of the city once called "The glory of kingdoms"
   (Isa.13:19) was foretold by the prophets (Isa.13:4-22; Jer.
   25:12; 50:2, 3; Dan. 2:31-38).
   
     The Babylon mentioned in 1 Pet. 5:13 was not Rome, as some
   have thought, but the literal city of Babylon, which was
   inhabited by many Jews at the time Peter wrote.
   
     In Rev. 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; and 18:2, "Babylon" is supposed to
   mean Rome, not considered as pagan, but as the prolongation of
   the ancient power in the papal form. Rome, pagan and papal, is
   regarded as one power. "The literal Babylon was the beginner and
   supporter of tyranny and idolatry...This city and its whole
   empire were taken by the Persians under Cyrus; the Persians were
   subdued by the Macedonians, and the Macedonians by the Romans;
   so that Rome succeeded to the power of old Babylon. And it was
   her method to adopt the worship of the false deities she had
   conquered; so that by her own act she became the heiress and
   successor of all the Babylonian idolatry, and of all that was
   introduced into it by the immediate successors of Babylon, and
   consequently of all the idolatry of the earth." Rome, or
   "mystical Babylon," is "that great city which reigneth over the
   kings of the earth" (17:18).
