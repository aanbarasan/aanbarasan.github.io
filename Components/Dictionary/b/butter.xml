      <WordDefinition>Butter
   (Heb. hemah), curdled milk (Gen. 18:8; Judg. 5:25; 2 Sam.
   17:29), or butter in the form of the skim of hot milk or cream,
   called by the Arabs kaimak, a semi-fluid (Job 20:17; 29:6; Deut.
   32:14). The words of Prov. 30:33 have been rendered by some "the
   pressure [not churning] of milk bringeth forth cheese."
