      <WordDefinition>Banana \Ba*na"na\ (b[.a]*n[aum]"n[.a]; 277), n. [Sp. banana,
   name of the fruit.] (Bot.)
   A perennial herbaceous plant of almost treelike size ({Musa
   sapientum}); also, its edible fruit. See {Musa}.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The banana has a soft, herbaceous stalk, with leaves of
         great length and breadth. The flowers grow in bunches,
         covered with a sheath of a green or purple color; the
         fruit is five or six inches long, and over an inch in
         diameter; the pulp is soft, and of a luscious taste,
         and is eaten either raw or cooked. This plant is a
         native of tropical countries, and furnishes an
         important article of food.
         [1913 Webster]
