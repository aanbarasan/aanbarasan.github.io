      <WordDefinition>Baldness
   from natural causes was uncommon (2 Kings 2:23; Isa. 3:24). It
   was included apparently under "scab" and "scurf," which
   disqualified for the priesthood (Lev. 21:20). The Egyptians were
   rarely subject to it. This probably arose from their custom of
   constantly shaving the head, only allowing the hair to grow as a
   sign of mourning. With the Jews artificial baldness was a sign
   of mourning (Isa. 22:12; Jer. 7:29; 16:6); it also marked the
   conclusion of a Nazarite's vow (Acts 18:18; 21:24; Num. 6:9). It
   is often alluded to (Micah 1:16; Amos 8:10; Jer. 47:5). The Jews
   were forbidden to follow the customs of surrounding nations in
   making themselves bald (Deut. 14:1).

   [1913 Webster]

         This gives to their syntax a peculiar character of
         simplicity and baldness.                 --W. D.
