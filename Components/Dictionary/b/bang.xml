      <WordDefinition>bang
     
        1. A common spoken name for "!" (ASCII 33), especially when
        used in pronouncing a {bang path} in spoken hackish.  In
        {elder days} this was considered a {CMU}ish usage, with {MIT}
        and {Stanford} hackers preferring {excl} or {shriek}; but the
        spread of {Unix} has carried "bang" with it (especially via
        the term {bang path}) and it is now certainly the most common
        spoken name for "!".  Note that it is used exclusively for
        non-emphatic written "!"; one would not say "Congratulations
        bang" (except possibly for humorous purposes), but if one
        wanted to specify the exact characters "foo!" one would speak
        "Eff oh oh bang".
     
        See {pling}, {shriek}, {ASCII}.
     
        2. An exclamation signifying roughly "I have achieved
        enlightenment!", or "The dynamite has cleared out my brain!"
        Often used to acknowledge that one has perpetrated a {thinko}
        immediately after one has been called on it.
