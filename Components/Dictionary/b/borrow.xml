      <WordDefinition>Borrow
   The Israelites "borrowed" from the Egyptians (Ex. 12:35, R.V.,
   "asked") in accordance with a divine command (3:22; 11:2). But
   the word (sha'al) so rendered here means simply and always to
   "request" or "demand." The Hebrew had another word which is
   properly translated "borrow" in Deut. 28:12; Ps. 37:21. It was
   well known that the parting was final. The Egyptians were so
   anxious to get the Israelites away out of their land that "they
   let them have what they asked" (Ex. 12:36, R.V.), or literally
   "made them to ask," urged them to take whatever they desired and
   depart. (See {LOAN}.)
