      <WordDefinition>Bit
   the curb put into the mouths of horses to restrain them. The
   Hebrew word (metheg) so rendered in Ps. 32:9 is elsewhere
   translated "bridle" (2 Kings 19:28; Prov. 26:3; Isa. 37:29).
   Bits were generally made of bronze or iron, but sometimes also
   of gold or silver. In James 3:3 the Authorized Version
   translates the Greek word by "bits," but the Revised Version by
   "bridles."

      <WordDefinition>bit
     
        &lt;unit&gt; (b) {binary} digit.
     
        The unit of information; the amount of information obtained by
        asking a yes-or-no question; a computational quantity that can
        take on one of two values, such as false and true or 0 and 1;
        the smallest unit of storage - sufficient to hold one bit.
     
        A bit is said to be "set" if its value is true or 1, and
        "reset" or "clear" if its value is false or 0.  One speaks of
        setting and clearing bits.  To {toggle} or "invert" a bit is
        to change it, either from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.
     
        The term "bit" first appeared in print in the computer-science
        sense in 1949, and seems to have been coined by the eminent
        statistician, {John Tukey}.  Tukey records that it evolved
        over a lunch table as a handier alternative to "bigit" or
        "binit".
     
        See also {flag}, {trit}, {mode bit}, {byte}, {word}.

      <WordDefinition>bit n. [from the mainstream meaning and `Binary digIT'] 1. [techspeak]
   The unit of information; the amount of information obtained by asking a
   yes-or-no question for which the two outcomes are equally probable. 2.
   [techspeak] A computational quantity that can take on one of two values,
   such as true and false or 0 and 1. 3. A mental flag: a reminder that
   something should be done eventually. "I have a bit set for you." (I
   haven't seen you for a while, and I'm supposed to tell or ask you
   something.) 4. More generally, a (possibly incorrect) mental state of
   belief. "I have a bit set that says that you were the last guy to hack
   on EMACS." (Meaning "I think you were the last guy to hack on EMACS, and
   what I am about to say is predicated on this, so please stop me if this
   isn't true.")

   "I just need one bit from you" is a polite way of indicating that you
   intend only a short interruption for a question that can presumably be
   answered yes or no.

   A bit is said to be `set' if its value is true or 1, and `reset' or
   `clear' if its value is false or 0. One speaks of setting and clearing
   bits. To {toggle} or `invert' a bit is to change it, either from 0 to 1
   or from 1 to 0. See also {flag}, {trit}, {mode bit}.

   The term `bit' first appeared in print in the computer-science sense
   in a 1948 paper by information theorist Claude Shannon, and was there
   credited to the early computer scientist John Tukey (who also seems to
   have coined the term `software'). Tukey records that `bit' evolved over
   a lunch table as a handier alternative to `bigit' or `binit', at a
   conference in the winter of 1943-44.
