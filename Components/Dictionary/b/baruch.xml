      <WordDefinition>Baruch
   blessed. (1.) The secretary of the prophet Jeremiah (32:12;
   36:4). He was of the tribe of Judah (51:59). To him Jeremiah
   dictated his prophecies regarding the invasion of the
   Babylonians and the Captivity. These he read to the people from
   a window in the temple in the fourth year of the reign of
   Jehoiakim, king of Judah (Jer. 36). He afterwards read them
   before the counsellors of the king at a private interview; and
   then to the king himself, who, after hearing a part of the roll,
   cut it with a penknife, and threw it into the fire of his winter
   parlour, where he was sitting.
   
     During the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, he was the
   keeper of the deed of purchase Jeremiah had made of the
   territory of Hanameel (Jer. 32:12). Being accused by his enemies
   of favouring the Chaldeans, he was cast, with Jeremiah, into
   prison, where he remained till the capture of Jerusalem (B.C.
   586). He probably died in Babylon.
   
     (2.) Neh. 3:20; 10:6; 11:5.
