      <WordDefinition>Blossom \Blos"som\ (bl[o^]s"s[u^]m), n. [OE. blosme, blostme,
   AS. bl[=o]sma, bl[=o]stma, blossom; akin to D. bloesem, L.
   fios, and E. flower; from the root of E. blow to blossom. See
   {Blow} to blossom, and cf. {Bloom} a blossom.]
   1. The flower of a plant, or the essential organs of
      reproduction, with their appendages; florescence; bloom;
      the flowers of a plant, collectively; as, the blossoms and
      fruit of a tree; an apple tree in blossom.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The term has been applied by some botanists, and is
         also applied in common usage, to the corolla. It is
         more commonly used than flower or bloom, when we have
         reference to the fruit which is to succeed. Thus we use
         flowers when we speak of plants cultivated for
         ornament, and bloom in a more general sense, as of
         flowers in general, or in reference to the beauty of
         flowers.
         [1913 Webster]

               Blossoms flaunting in the eye of day.
                                                  --Longfellow.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. A blooming period or stage of development; something
      lovely that gives rich promise.
      [1913 Webster]

            In the blossom of my youth.           --Massinger.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. The color of a horse that has white hairs intermixed with
      sorrel and bay hairs; -- otherwise called peach color.
      [1913 Webster]

   {In blossom}, having the blossoms open; in bloom.
      [1913 Webster]
