      <WordDefinition>Beast
   This word is used of flocks or herds of grazing animals (Ex.
   22:5; Num. 20:4, 8, 11; Ps. 78:48); of beasts of burden (Gen.
   45:17); of eatable beasts (Prov. 9:2); and of swift beasts or
   dromedaries (Isa. 60:6). In the New Testament it is used of a
   domestic animal as property (Rev. 18:13); as used for food (1
   Cor. 15:39), for service (Luke 10:34; Acts 23:24), and for
   sacrifice (Acts 7:42).
   
     When used in contradistinction to man (Ps. 36:6), it denotes a
   brute creature generally, and when in contradistinction to
   creeping things (Lev. 11:2-7; 27:26), a four-footed animal.
   
     The Mosaic law required that beasts of labour should have rest
   on the Sabbath (Ex. 20:10; 23:12), and in the Sabbatical year
   all cattle were allowed to roam about freely, and eat whatever
   grew in the fields (Ex. 23:11; Lev. 25:7). No animal could be
   castrated (Lev. 22:24). Animals of different kinds were to be
   always kept separate (Lev. 19:19; Deut. 22:10). Oxen when used
   in threshing were not to be prevented from eating what was
   within their reach (Deut. 25:4; 1 Cor.9:9).
   
     This word is used figuratively of an infuriated multitude (1
   Cor. 15:32; Acts 19:29; comp. Ps. 22:12, 16; Eccl. 3:18; Isa.
   11:6-8), and of wicked men (2 Pet. 2:12). The four beasts of
   Daniel 7:3, 17, 23 represent four kingdoms or kings.

      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: {Beast}, {Brute}.

   Usage: When we use these words in a figurative sense, as
          applicable to human beings, we think of beasts as mere
          animals governed by animal appetite; and of brutes as
          being destitute of reason or moral feeling, and
          governed by unrestrained passion. Hence we speak of
          beastly appetites; beastly indulgences, etc.; and of
          brutal manners; brutal inhumanity; brutal ferocity.
          So, also, we say of a drunkard, that he first made
          himself a beast, and then treated his family like a
          brute.
          [1913 Webster]
