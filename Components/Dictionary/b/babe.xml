      <WordDefinition>BABE or :BABY:, n.  A misshapen creature of no particular age, sex, or
condition, chiefly remarkable for the violence of the sympathies and
antipathies it excites in others, itself without sentiment or emotion. 
There have been famous babes; for example, little Moses, from whose
adventure in the bulrushes the Egyptian hierophants of seven centuries
before doubtless derived their idle tale of the child Osiris being
preserved on a floating lotus leaf.

            Ere babes were invented
            The girls were contended.
            Now man is tormented
    Until to buy babes he has squandered
    His money.  And so I have pondered
            This thing, and thought may be
            'T were better that Baby
    The First had been eagled or condored.

      <WordDefinition>Babe
   used of children generally (Matt. 11:25; 21:16; Luke 10:21; Rom.
   2:20). It is used also of those who are weak in Christian faith
   and knowledge (1 Cor. 3:1; Heb. 5:13; 1 Pet. 2:2). In Isa. 3:4
   the word "babes" refers to a succession of weak and wicked
   princes who reigned over Judah from the death of Josiah downward
   to the destruction of Jerusalem.
