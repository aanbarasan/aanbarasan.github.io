      <WordDefinition>Butler
   properly a servant in charge of the wine (Gen. 40:1-13; 41:9).
   The Hebrew word, _mashkeh_, thus translated is rendered also
   (plural) "cup-bearers" (1 Kings 10:5; 2 Chr. 9:4). Nehemiah
   (1:11) was cup-bearer to king Artaxerxes. It was a position of
   great responsibility and honour in royal households.
