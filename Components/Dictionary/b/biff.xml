        /bif/ To notify someone of incoming mail.  From the {BSD}
        utility "biff(1)", which was in turn named after a friendly
        golden Labrador who used to chase frisbees in the halls at UCB
        while {4.2BSD} was in development (it had a well-known habit
        of barking whenever the mailman came).  No relation to {BIFF}.

      <WordDefinition>BIFF
     
        /bif/ (Or "B1FF", from {Usenet}) The most famous {pseudo}, and
        the prototypical {newbie}.  Articles from BIFF are
        characterised by all uppercase letters sprinkled liberally
        with bangs, typos, "cute" misspellings (EVRY BUDY LUVS GOOD
        OLD BIFF CUZ HE'S A K00L DOOD AN HE RITES REEL AWESUM THINGZ
        IN CAPITULL LETTRS LIKE THIS!!!), use (and often misuse) of
        fragments of {chat} abbreviations, a long {sig block}
        (sometimes even a {doubled sig}), and unbounded naivete.  BIFF
        posts articles using his elder brother's VIC-20.  BIFF's
        location is a mystery, as his articles appear to come from a
        variety of sites.  However, {BITNET} seems to be the most
        frequent origin.  The theory that BIFF is a denizen of BITNET
        is supported by BIFF's (unfortunately invalid) {electronic
        mail address}: &lt;BIFF@BIT.NET&gt;.
     
        [1993: Now It Can Be Told!  My spies inform me that BIFF was
        originally created by Joe Talmadge &lt;jat@cup.hp.com&gt;, also the
        author of the infamous and much-plagiarised "Flamer's Bible".
        The BIFF filter he wrote was later passed to Richard Sexton,
        who posted BIFFisms much more widely.  Versions have since
        been posted for the amusement of the net at large. - ESR]

      <WordDefinition>biff /bif/ vt. To notify someone of incoming mail. From the BSD utility
   `biff(1)', which was in turn named after a friendly dog who used to
   chase frisbees in the halls at UCB while 4.2BSD was in development.
   There was a legend that it had a habit of barking whenever the mailman
   came, but the author of `biff' says this is not true. No relation to
   {B1FF}.
