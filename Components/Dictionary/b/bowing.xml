      <WordDefinition>Bowing
   a mode of showing respect. Abraham "bowed himself to the people
   of the land" (Gen. 23:7); so Jacob to Esau (Gen. 33:3); and the
   brethren of Joseph before him as the governor of the land (Gen.
   43:28). Bowing is also frequently mentioned as an act of
   adoration to idols (Josh. 23:7; 2 Kings 5:18; Judg. 2:19; Isa.
   44:15), and to God (Josh. 5:14; Ps. 22:29; 72:9; Micah 6:6; Ps.
   95:6; Eph. 3:14).
