   the making of, formed the chief labour of the Israelites in
   Egypt (Ex. 1:13, 14). Those found among the ruins of Babylon and
   Nineveh are about a foot square and four inches thick. They were
   usually dried in the sun, though also sometimes in kilns (2 Sam.
   12:31; Jer. 43:9; Nah. 3:14). (See {NEBUCHADNEZZAR}.)
   
     The bricks used in the tower of Babel were burnt bricks,
   cemented in the building by bitumen (Gen. 11:3).
