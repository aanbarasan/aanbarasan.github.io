      <WordDefinition>Beetle
   (Heb. hargol, meaning "leaper"). Mention of it is made only in
   Lev. 11:22, where it is obvious the word cannot mean properly
   the beetle. It denotes some winged creeper with at least four
   feet, "which has legs above its feet, to leap withal." The
   description plainly points to the locust (q.v.). This has been
   an article of food from the earliest times in the East to the
   present day. The word is rendered "cricket" in the Revised
   Version.
