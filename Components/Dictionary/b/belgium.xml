   Introduction Belgium
   --------------------
                            Background: Belgium became independent from the
                                        Netherlands in 1830 and was occupied
                                        by Germany during World Wars I and
                                        II. It has prospered in the past
                                        half century as a modern,
                                        technologically advanced European
                                        state and member of NATO and the EU.
                                        Tensions between the Dutch-speaking
                                        Flemings of the north and the
                                        French-speaking Walloons of the
                                        south have led in recent years to
                                        constitutional amendments granting
                                        these regions formal recognition and
                                        autonomy.

   Economy Belgium
   ---------------
                    Economy - overview: This modern private enterprise
                                        economy has capitalized on its
                                        central geographic location, highly
                                        developed transport network, and
                                        diversified industrial and
                                        commercial base. Industry is
                                        concentrated mainly in the populous
                                        Flemish area in the north. With few
                                        natural resources, Belgium must
                                        import substantial quantities of raw
                                        materials and export a large volume
                                        of manufactures, making its economy
                                        unusually dependent on the state of
                                        world markets. About three-quarters
                                        of its trade is with other EU
                                        countries. Belgium's public debt is
                                        expected to fall to about 100% of
                                        GDP in 2002, and the government has
                                        succeeded in balancing its budget.
                                        Belgium, together with 11 of its EU
                                        partners, began circulating euro
                                        currency in January 2002. Economic
                                        growth in 2001 dropped sharply due
                                        to the global economic slowdown.
                                        Prospects for 2002 depend largely on
                                        recovery in the EU and the US.
