      <WordDefinition>braille
     
        &lt;human language&gt; /breyl/ (Often capitalised) A class of
        {writing systems}, intended for use by blind and low-vision
        users, which express {glyphs} as raised dots.  Currently
        employed braille standards use eight dots per cell, where a
        cell is a glyph-space two dots across by four dots high; most
        glyphs use only the top six dots.
     
        Braille was developed by Louis Braille (pronounced /looy
        bray/) in France in the 1820s.  Braille systems for most
        languages can be fairly trivially converted to and from the
        usual script.
     
        Braille has several totally coincidental parallels with
        digital computing: it is {binary}, it is based on groups of
        eight bits/dots and its development began in the 1820s, at the
        same time {Charles Babbage} proposed the {Difference Engine}.
     
        Computers output Braille on {braille displays} and {braille
        printers} for hard copy.
