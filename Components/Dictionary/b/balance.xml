      <WordDefinition>Balance
   occurs in Lev. 19:36 and Isa. 46:6, as the rendering of the
   Hebrew _kanch'_, which properly means "a reed" or "a cane," then
   a rod or beam of a balance. This same word is translated
   "measuring reed" in Ezek. 40:3,5; 42:16-18. There is another
   Hebrew word, _mozena'yim_, i.e., "two poisers", also so rendered
   (Dan. 5:27). The balances as represented on the most ancient
   Egyptian monuments resemble those now in use. A "pair of
   balances" is a symbol of justice and fair dealing (Job 31:6; Ps.
   62:9; Prov. 11:1). The expression denotes great want and
   scarcity in Rev. 6:5.

         extremities. Another form is that of the Roman balance,
         our steelyard, consisting of a lever or beam, suspended
         near one of its extremities, on the longer arm of which
         a counterpoise slides. The name is also given to other
         forms of apparatus for weighing bodies, as to the
         combinations of levers making up platform scales; and
