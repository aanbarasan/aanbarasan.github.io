   Syn: To {Banish}, {Exile}, {Expel}.

   Usage: The idea of a coercive removal from a place is common
          to these terms. A man is banished when he is forced by
          the government of a country (be he a foreigner or a
          native) to leave its borders. A man is exiled when he
          is driven into banishment from his native country and
          home. Thus to exile is to banish, but to banish is not
          always to exile. To expel is to eject or banish
          summarily or authoritatively, and usually under
          circumstances of disgrace; as, to expel from a
          college; expelled from decent society.
          [1913 Webster]
