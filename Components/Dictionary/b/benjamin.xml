      <WordDefinition>Benjamin
   son of my right hand. (1.) The younger son of Jacob by Rachel
   (Gen. 35:18). His birth took place at Ephrath, on the road
   between Bethel and Bethlehem, at a short distance from the
   latter place. His mother died in giving him birth, and with her
   last breath named him Ben-oni, son of my pain, a name which was
   changed by his father into Benjamin. His posterity are called
   Benjamites (Gen. 49:27; Deut. 33:12; Josh. 18:21).
   
     The tribe of Benjamin at the Exodus was the smallest but one
   (Num. 1:36, 37; Ps. 68:27). During the march its place was along
   with Manasseh and Ephraim on the west of the tabernacle. At the
   entrance into Canaan it counted 45,600 warriors. It has been
   inferred by some from the words of Jacob (Gen. 49:27) that the
   figure of a wolf was on the tribal standard. This tribe is
   mentioned in Rom. 11:1; Phil. 3:5.
   
     The inheritance of this tribe lay immediately to the south of
   that of Ephraim, and was about 26 miles in length and 12 in
   breadth. Its eastern boundary was the Jordan. Dan intervened
   between it and the Philistines. Its chief towns are named in
   Josh. 18:21-28.
   
     The history of the tribe contains a sad record of a desolating
   civil war in which they were engaged with the other eleven
   tribes. By it they were almost exterminated (Judg. 20:20, 21;
   21:10). (See {GIBEAH}.)
   
     The first king of the Jews was Saul, a Benjamite. A close
   alliance was formed between this tribe and that of Judah in the
   time of David (2 Sam. 19:16, 17), which continued after his
   death (1 Kings 11:13; 12:20). After the Exile these two tribes
   formed the great body of the Jewish nation (Ezra 1:5; 10:9).
   
     The tribe of Benjamin was famous for its archers (1 Sam.
   20:20, 36; 2 Sam. 1:22; 1 Chr. 8:40; 12:2) and slingers (Judge.
   20:6).
   
     The gate of Benjamin, on the north side of Jerusalem (Jer.
   37:13; 38:7; Zech. 14:10), was so called because it led in the
   direction of the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. It is
   called by Jeremiah (20:2) "the high gate of Benjamin;" also "the
   gate of the children of the people" (17:19). (Comp. 2 Kings
   14:13.)
