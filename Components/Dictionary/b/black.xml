      <WordDefinition>Black
   properly the absence of all colour. In Prov. 7:9 the Hebrew word
   means, as in the margin of the Revised Version, "the pupil of
   the eye." It is translated "apple" of the eye in Deut. 32:10;
   Ps. 17:8; Prov. 7:2. It is a different word which is rendered
   "black" in Lev. 13:31,37; Cant. 1:5; 5:11; and Zech. 6:2, 6. It
   is uncertain what the "black marble" of Esther 1:6 was which
   formed a part of the mosaic pavement.
