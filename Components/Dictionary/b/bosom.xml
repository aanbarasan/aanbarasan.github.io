      <WordDefinition>Bosom
   In the East objects are carried in the bosom which Europeans
   carry in the pocket. To have in one's bosom indicates kindness,
   secrecy, or intimacy (Gen. 16:5; 2 Sam. 12:8). Christ is said to
   have been in "the bosom of the Father," i.e., he had the most
   perfect knowledge of the Father, had the closest intimacy with
   him (John 1:18). John (13:23) was "leaning on Jesus' bosom" at
   the last supper. Our Lord carries his lambs in his bosom, i.e.,
   has a tender, watchful care over them (Isa. 40:11).
