      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: {Burden}, {Load}.

   Usage: A burden is, in the literal sense, a weight to be
          borne; a load is something laid upon us to be carried.
          Hence, when used figuratively, there is usually a
          difference between the two words. Our burdens may be
          of such a nature that we feel bound to bear them
          cheerfully or without complaint. They may arise from
          the nature of our situation; they may be allotments of
          Providence; they may be the consequences of our
          errors. What is upon us, as a load, we commonly carry
          with greater reluctance or sense of oppression. Men
          often find the charge of their own families to be a
          burden; but if to this be added a load of care for
          others, the pressure is usually serve and irksome.
