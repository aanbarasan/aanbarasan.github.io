      <WordDefinition>Booty
   captives or cattle or objects of value taken in war. In Canaan
   all that breathed were to be destroyed (Deut. 20: 16). The
   "pictures and images" of the Canaanites were to be destroyed
   also (Num. 33:52). The law of booty as to its division is laid
   down in Num. 31:26-47. David afterwards introduced a regulation
   that the baggage-guard should share the booty equally with the
   soldiers engaged in battle. He also devoted of the spoils of war
   for the temple (1 Sam. 30:24-26; 2 Sam. 8:11; 1 Chr. 26:27).
