      <WordDefinition>Bag
   (1.) A pocket of a cone-like shape in which Naaman bound two
   pieces of silver for Gehazi (2 Kings 5:23). The same Hebrew word
   occurs elsewhere only in Isa. 3:22, where it is rendered
   "crisping-pins," but denotes the reticules (or as R.V.,
   "satchels") carried by Hebrew women.
   
     (2.) Another word (kees) so rendered means a bag for carrying
   weights (Deut. 25:13; Prov. 16:11; Micah 6:11). It also denotes
   a purse (Prov. 1:14) and a cup (23:31).
   
     (3.) Another word rendered "bag" in 1 Sam. 17:40 is rendered
   "sack" in Gen. 42:25; and in 1 Sam. 9:7; 21:5 "vessel," or
   wallet for carrying food.
   
     (4.) The word rendered in the Authorized Version "bags," in
   which the priests bound up the money contributed for the
   restoration of the temple (2 Kings 12:10), is also rendered
   "bundle" (Gen. 42:35; 1 Sam. 25:29). It denotes bags used by
   travellers for carrying money during a journey (Prov. 7:20; Hag.
   1:6).
   
     (5.) The "bag" of Judas was a small box (John 12:6; 13:29).
