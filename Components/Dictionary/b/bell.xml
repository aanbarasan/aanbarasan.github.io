      <WordDefinition>Bell
   The bells first mentioned in Scripture are the small golden
   bells attached to the hem of the high priest's ephod (Ex. 28:33,
   34, 35). The "bells of the horses" mentioned by Zechariah
   (14:20) were attached to the bridles or belts round the necks of
   horses trained for war, so as to accustom them to noise and
   tumult.

      <WordDefinition>bell
     
        &lt;character&gt; {ASCII} 7, ASCII {mnemonic} "BEL", the {character
        code} which prodces a standard audibile warning from the
        computer or {terminal}.  In the {teletype} days it really was a
        bell, since the advent of the {VDU} it is more likely to be a
        sound sample (e.g. the sound of a bell) played through a
        loudspeaker.
     
        Also called "G-bell", because it is typed as Control-G.
     
        The term "beep" is preferred among some {microcomputer}
        hobbyists.
     
        Compare {feep}, {visible bell}.
