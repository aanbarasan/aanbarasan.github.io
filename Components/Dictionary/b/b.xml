        2. &lt;language&gt; A systems language written by {Ken Thompson} in
        1970 mostly for his own use under {Unix} on the {PDP-11}.  B
        was later improved by Kerninghan(?) and Ritchie to produce
        {C}.  B was used as the systems language on {Honeywell}'s
        {GCOS-3}.
     
        B was, according to Ken, greatly influenced by {BCPL}, but the
        name B had nothing to do with BCPL.  B was in fact a revision
        of an earlier language, {bon}, named after Ken Thompson's
        wife, Bonnie.

        been used in major {safety-critical system} specifications in
        Europe, and is currently attracting increasing interest in
        industry.  It has robust, commercially available tool support
        for specification, design, proof and code generation.

      <WordDefinition>Gastropoda \Gas*trop"o*da\, n. pl., [NL., fr. Gr. ?, ?, stomach
   + -poda.] (Zo["o]l.)
   One of the classes of Mollusca, of great extent. It includes
   most of the marine spiral shells, and the land and
   fresh-water snails. They generally creep by means of a flat,
   muscular disk, or foot, on the ventral side of the body. The
   head usually bears one or two pairs of tentacles. See
   {Mollusca}. [Written also {Gasteropoda}.]
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The Gastropoda are divided into three subclasses; viz.:
         ({a}) The Streptoneura or Dioecia, including the
         Pectinibranchiata, Rhipidoglossa, Docoglossa, and
         Heteropoda. ({b}) The Euthyneura, including the
         Pulmonata and Opisthobranchia. ({c}) The Amphineura,
         including the Polyplacophora and Aplacophora.

      <WordDefinition>Infinitive \In*fin"i*tive\, n. [L. infinitivus: cf. F.
   infinitif. See {Infinite}.]
   Unlimited; not bounded or restricted; undefined.
   [1913 Webster]

   {Infinitive mood} (Gram.), that form of the verb which merely
      names the action, and performs the office of a verbal
      noun. Some grammarians make two forms in English: ({a})
      The simple form, as, speak, go, hear, before which to is
      commonly placed, as, to speak; to go; to hear. ({b}) The
      form of the imperfect participle, called the infinitive in
      -ing; as, going is as easy as standing.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: With the auxiliary verbs may, can, must, might, could,
         would, and should, the simple infinitive is expressed
         without to; as, you may speak; they must hear, etc. The
         infinitive usually omits to with the verbs let, dare,
         do, bid, make, see, hear, need, etc.; as, let me go;
         you dare not tell; make him work; hear him talk, etc.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: In Anglo-Saxon, the simple infinitive was not preceded
         by to (the sign of modern simple infinitive), but it
         had a dative form (sometimes called the gerundial
         infinitive) which was preceded by to, and was chiefly
         employed in expressing purpose. See {Gerund}, 2.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: The gerundial ending (-anne) not only took the same
         form as the simple infinitive (-an), but it was
         confounded with the present participle in -ende, or
         -inde (later -inge).

         and the latter class being sent to foreign countries on

         ({c}) Legati nati, or legates by virtue of their

      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Astron.) A real or apparent libratory motion, like that

   {Libration of the moon}, any one of those small periodical
      changes in the position of the moon's surface relatively
      to the earth, in consequence of which narrow portions at
      opposite limbs become visible or invisible alternately. It
      receives different names according to the manner in which
      it takes place; as: {(a)} Libration in longitude, that
      which, depending on the place of the moon in its elliptic
      orbit, causes small portions near the eastern and western
      borders alternately to appear and disappear each month.
      ({b}) Libration in latitude, that which depends on the
      varying position of the moon's axis in respect to the
      spectator, causing the alternate appearance and
      disappearance of either pole. ({c}) Diurnal or parallactic
      libration, that which brings into view on the upper limb,
      at rising and setting, some parts not in the average
      visible hemisphere.

      <WordDefinition>Respiration \Res`pi*ra"tion\ (r?s`p?*r?"sh?n), n. [L.
   respiratio: cf. F. respiration. See {Respire}.]
   1. The act of respiring or breathing again, or catching one's
      breath.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Relief from toil or suffering: rest. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

            Till the day
            Appear of respiration to the just
            And vengeance to the wicked.          --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Interval; intermission. [Obs.] --Bp. Hall.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. (Physiol.) The act of resping or breathing; the act of
      taking in and giving out air; the aggregate of those
      processes bu which oxygen is introduced into the system,
      and carbon dioxide, or carbonic acid, removed.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Respiration in the higher animals is divided into:
         ({a}) Internal respiration, or the interchange of
         oxygen and carbonic acid between the cells of the body
         and the bathing them, which in one sense is a process
         of nutrition. ({b}) External respiration, or the
         gaseous interchange taking place in the special
         respiratory organs, the lungs. This constitutes
         respiration proper. --Gamgee.
         [1913 Webster] In the respiration of plants oxygen is
         likewise absorbed and carbonic acid exhaled, but in the
         light this process is obscured by another process which
         goes on with more vigor, in which the plant inhales and
         absorbs carbonic acid and exhales free oxygen.

         Some have no tail, as the apes. All these are natives

   is the second letter of the English alphabet. (See Guide to
   Pronunciation, [sect][sect] 196, 220.) It is etymologically

   Anglo-Saxon seofon, Ger. sieben, Lat. septem, Gr."epta`,

         second tone in it's relative minor scale (that of A
         minor). B[flat] stands for B flat, the tone a half
         step, or semitone, lower than B. In German, B stands
         for our B[flat], while our B natural is called H
         (pronounced h["a]).

      <WordDefinition>Ferment \Fer"ment\, n. [L. fermentum ferment (in senses 1 &amp; 2),
   perh. for fervimentum, fr. fervere to be boiling hot, boil,
   ferment: cf. F. ferment. Cf. 1st {Barm}, {Fervent}.]
   1. That which causes fermentation, as yeast, barm, or
      fermenting beer.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Ferments are of two kinds: ({a}) Formed or organized
         ferments. ({b}) Unorganized or structureless ferments.
         The latter are now called {enzymes} and were formerly
         called {soluble ferments} or {chemical ferments}.
         Ferments of the first class are as a rule simple
         microscopic vegetable organisms, and the fermentations
         which they engender are due to their growth and
         development; as, the {acetic ferment}, the {butyric
         ferment}, etc. See {Fermentation}. Ferments of the
         second class, on the other hand, are chemical
         substances; as a rule they are proteins soluble in
         glycerin and precipitated by alcohol. In action they
         are catalytic and, mainly, hydrolytic. Good examples
         are pepsin of the dastric juice, ptyalin of the salvia,
         and disease of malt. Before 1960 the term "ferment" to
         mean "enzyme" fell out of use. Enzymes are now known to
         be {globular protein}s, capable of catalyzing a wide
         variety of chemical reactions, not merely hydrolytic.
         The full set of enzymes causing production of ethyl
         alcohol from sugar has been identified and individually
         purified and studied. See {enzyme}.
