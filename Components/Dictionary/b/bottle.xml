      <WordDefinition>Bottle
   a vessel made of skins for holding wine (Josh. 9:4. 13; 1 Sam.
   16:20; Matt. 9:17; Mark 2:22; Luke 5:37, 38), or milk (Judg.
   4:19), or water (Gen. 21:14, 15, 19), or strong drink (Hab.
   2:15).
   
     Earthenware vessels were also similarly used (Jer. 19:1-10; 1
   Kings 14:3; Isa. 30:14). In Job 32:19 (comp. Matt. 9:17; Luke
   5:37, 38; Mark 2:22) the reference is to a wine-skin ready to
   burst through the fermentation of the wine. "Bottles of wine" in
   the Authorized Version of Hos. 7:5 is properly rendered in the
   Revised Version by "the heat of wine," i.e., the fever of wine,
   its intoxicating strength.
   
     The clouds are figuratively called the "bottles of heaven"
   (Job 38:37). A bottle blackened or shrivelled by smoke is
   referred to in Ps. 119:83 as an image to which the psalmist
   likens himself.
