      <WordDefinition>path
     
        1. &lt;networking&gt; A {bang path} or explicitly routed {Internet
        address}; a node-by-node specification of a link between two
        machines.
     
        2. &lt;file system&gt; {pathname}.
     
        3. &lt;operating system&gt;  The list of directories the kernel
        (under {Unix}) or the command interpreter (under {MS-DOS})
        searches for {executables}.  It is stored as part of the
        {environment} in both operating systems.
     
        Other, similar constructs abound under Unix; the {C}
        {preprocessor}, for example, uses such a search path to locate
        "#include" files.

      <WordDefinition>path n. 1. A {bang path} or explicitly routed {{Internet address}}; a
   node-by-node specification of a link between two machines. Though these
   are now obsolete as a form of addressing, they still show up in
   diagnostics and trace headers occasionally (e.g. in NNTP headers). 2.
   [Unix] A filename, fully specified relative to the root directory (as
   opposed to relative to the current directory; the latter is sometimes
   called a `relative path'). This is also called a `pathname'. 3. [Unix
   and MS-DOS] The `search path', an environment variable specifying the
   directories in which the {shell} (COMMAND.COM, under MS-DOS) should look
   for commands. Other, similar constructs abound under Unix (for example,
   the C preprocessor has a `search path' it uses in looking for `#include'
   files).
