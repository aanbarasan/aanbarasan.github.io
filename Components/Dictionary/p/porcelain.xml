      <WordDefinition>Porcelain \Por"ce*lain\ (277), n. [F. porcelaine, It.
   porcellana, orig., the porcelain shell, or Venus shell
   (Cypr[ae]a porcellana), from a dim. fr. L. porcus pig,
   probably from the resemblance of the shell in shape to a
   pig's back. Porcelain was called after this shell, either on
   account of its smoothness and whiteness, or because it was
   believed to be made from it. See {Pork}.]
   A fine translucent or semitransculent kind of earthenware,
   made first in China and Japan, but now also in Europe and
   America; -- called also {China}, or {China ware}.
