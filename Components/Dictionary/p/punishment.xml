      <WordDefinition>Punishment
   The New Testament lays down the general principles of good
   government, but contains no code of laws for the punishment of
   offenders. Punishment proceeds on the principle that there is an
   eternal distinction between right and wrong, and that this
   distinction must be maintained for its own sake. It is not
   primarily intended for the reformation of criminals, nor for the
   purpose of deterring others from sin. These results may be
   gained, but crime in itself demands punishment. (See MURDER
   ï¿½T0002621; {THEFT}.)
   
     Endless, of the impenitent and unbelieving. The rejection of
   this doctrine "cuts the ground from under the gospel...blots out
   the attribute of retributive justice; transmutes sin into
   misfortune instead of guilt; turns all suffering into
   chastisement; converts the piacular work of Christ into moral
   influence...The attempt to retain the evangelical theology in
   connection with it is futile" (Shedd).
