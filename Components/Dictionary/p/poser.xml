      <WordDefinition>poser n. [from French `poseur'] A {wannabee}; not hacker slang, but
   used among crackers, phreaks and {warez d00dz}. Not as negative as
   {lamer} or {leech}. Probably derives from a similar usage among
   punk-rockers and metalheads, putting down those who "talk the talk but
   don't walk the walk".
