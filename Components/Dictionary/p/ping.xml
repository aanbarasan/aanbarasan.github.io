      <WordDefinition>ping [from the submariners' term for a sonar pulse] 1. n. Slang term
   for a small network message (ICMP ECHO) sent by a computer to check for
   the presence and alertness of another. The Unix command `ping(8)' can be
   used to do this manually (note that `ping(8)''s author denies the
   widespread folk etymology that the name was ever intended as an acronym
   for `Packet INternet Groper'). Occasionally used as a phone greeting.
   See {ACK}, also {ENQ}. 2. vt. To verify the presence of. 3. vt. To get
   the attention of. 4. vt. To send a message to all members of a {mailing
   list} requesting an {ACK} (in order to verify that everybody's addresses
   are reachable). "We haven't heard much of anything from Geoff, but he
   did respond with an ACK both times I pinged jargon-friends." 5. n. A
   quantum packet of happiness. People who are very happy tend to exude
   pings; furthermore, one can intentionally create pings and aim them at a
   needy party (e.g., a depressed person). This sense of ping may appear as
   an exclamation; "Ping!" (I'm happy; I am emitting a quantum of
   happiness; I have been struck by a quantum of happiness). The form
   "pingfulness", which is used to describe people who exude pings, also
   occurs. (In the standard abuse of language, "pingfulness" can also be
   used as an exclamation, in which case it's a much stronger exclamation
   than just "ping"!). Oppose {blargh}.

   The funniest use of `ping' to date was described in January 1991 by
   Steve Hayman on the Usenet group comp.sys.next. He was trying to isolate
   a faulty cable segment on a TCP/IP Ethernet hooked up to a NeXT machine,
   and got tired of having to run back to his console after each cabling
   tweak to see if the ping packets were getting through. So he used the
   sound-recording feature on the NeXT, then wrote a script that repeatedly
   invoked `ping(8)', listened for an echo, and played back the recording
   on each returned packet. Result? A program that caused the machine to
   repeat, over and over, "Ping ... ping ... ping ..." as long as the
   network was up. He turned the volume to maximum, ferreted through the
   building with one ear cocked, and found a faulty tee connector in no
   time.
