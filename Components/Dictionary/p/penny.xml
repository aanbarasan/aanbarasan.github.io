      <WordDefinition>Penny
   (Gr. denarion), a silver coin of the value of about 7 1/2d. or
   8d. of our present money. It is thus rendered in the New
   Testament, and is more frequently mentioned than any other coin
   (Matt. 18:28; 20:2, 9, 13; Mark 6:37; 14:5, etc.). It was the
   daily pay of a Roman soldier in the time of Christ. In the reign
   of Edward III. an English penny was a labourer's day's wages.
   This was the "tribute money" with reference to which our Lord
   said, "Whose image and superscription is this?" When they
   answered, "Caesar's," he replied, "Render therefore to Caesar
   the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are
   God's" (Matt. 22:19; Mark 12:15).

      <WordDefinition>Penny \Pen*ny\, n.; pl. {Pennies}or {Pence}. Pennies denotes the
   number of coins; pence the amount of pennies in value. [OE.
   peni, AS. penig, pening, pending; akin to D. penning, OHG.
   pfenning, pfenting, G. pfennig, Icel. penningr; of uncertain
   origin.]
   1. An English coin, formerly of copper, now of bronze, the
      twelfth part of an English shilling in account value, and
      equal to four farthings, or about two cents; -- usually
      indicated by the abbreviation d. (the initial of
      denarius).
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: ``The chief Anglo-Saxon coin, and for a long period the
         only one, corresponded to the denarius of the Continent
         . . . [and was] called penny, denarius, or denier.''
         --R. S. Poole. The ancient silver penny was worth about
         three pence sterling (see {Pennyweight}). The old
         Scotch penny was only one twelfth the value of the
         English coin. In the United States the word penny is
         popularly used for cent.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. Any small sum or coin; a groat; a stiver. --Shak.
