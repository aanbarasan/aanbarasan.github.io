      <WordDefinition>Corn \Corn\, n. [AS. corn; akin to OS. korn, D. koren, G., Dan.,

   Cf. {Grain}, {Kernel}.]

         sense 3), and in England to wheat.

   3. a tall cereal plant ({Zea mays}) bearing its seeds as
      large kernels in multiple rows on the surface of a hard
      cylindrical ear, the core of which (the cob) is not

      corn}, which grows chiefly in the Northern States, and is
      yellow when ripe; {white corn} or {southern corn}, which
      grows to a great height, and has long white kernels;

      varieties, grown chiefly at the North, some of which have
      kernels that wrinkle when ripe and dry; {pop corn}, any
      small variety, used for popping. Corn seeds may be cooked
      while on the ear and eaten directly, or may be stripped
      from the ear and cooked subsequently. The term {Indian
      corn} is often used to refer to a primitive type of corn
      having kernels of varied color borne on the same cob; it
      is used for decoration, especially in the fall.
