   1. A small Asiatic mammal ({Ailurus fulgens}) having fine
      soft fur, which inhabits the mountains of Northern India.
      It was once thought to be related to the bears, but is now
      believed to be more closely related to raccoons. It has
      reddish-brown fur on the back and sides, and black fur on
      the legs and underside. Called also the {lesser panda}.

      an endangered species, and is a popular attraction in the
      few zoos which have bveen able to obtain specimens.
