   Introduction Portugal
   ---------------------
                            Background: Following its heyday as a world
                                        power during the 15th and 16th
                                        centuries, Portugal lost much of its
                                        wealth and status with the
                                        destruction of Lisbon in a 1755
                                        earthquake, occupation during the
                                        Napoleonic Wars, and the
                                        independence in 1822 of Brazil as a
                                        colony. A 1910 revolution deposed
                                        the monarchy; for most of the next
                                        six decades repressive governments
                                        ran the country. In 1974, a left-
                                        wing military coup installed broad
                                        democratic reforms. The following
                                        year Portugal granted independence
                                        to all of its African colonies.
                                        Portugal entered the EC (now the
                                        EU)in 1985.

   Economy Portugal
   ----------------
                    Economy - overview: Portugal has become a diversified
                                        and increasingly service-based
                                        economy since joining the European
                                        Community in 1986. Over the past
                                        decade, successive governments have
                                        privatized many state-controlled
                                        firms and liberalized key areas of
                                        the economy, including the financial
                                        and telecommunications sectors. The
                                        country qualified for the European
                                        Monetary Union (EMU) in 1998 and
                                        began circulating its new currency,
                                        the euro, on 1 January 2002 along
                                        with 11 other EU member economies.
                                        Economic growth has been above the
                                        EU average for much of the past
                                        decade, but GDP per capita stands at
                                        just 75% of that of the leading EU
                                        economies. The government has failed
                                        to reign in a widening deficit and
                                        to advance structural reforms needed
                                        to boost Portugal's economic
                                        competitiveness. A poor educational
                                        system, in particular, has been an
                                        obstacle to greater productivity and
                                        growth. Portugal has been
                                        increasingly overshadowed by lower-
                                        cost producers in Central Europe and
                                        Asia as a target for foreign direct
                                        investment.
