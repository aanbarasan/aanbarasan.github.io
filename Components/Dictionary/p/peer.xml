      <WordDefinition>peer
     
        A unit of communications hardware or software that is on the
        same {protocol layer} of a network as another.  A common way
        of viewing a communications link is as two {protocol stack}s,
        which are actually connected only at the very lowest
        (physical) layer, but can be regarded as being connected at
        each higher layer by virtue of the services provided by the
        lower layers.  Peer-to-peer communication refers to these real
        or virtual connections between corresponding systems in each
        layer.
     
        To give a simple example, when two people talk to each other,
        the lowest layer is the physical layer which concerns the
        sound pressure waves travelling from mouth to ear (so mouths
        and ears are peers) the next layer might be the speech and
        hearing centres in the people's brains and the top layer their
        cerebellums or minds.  Although, barring telepathy, nothing
        passes directly between the two minds, there is a peer-to-peer
        communication between them.
