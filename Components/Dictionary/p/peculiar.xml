      <WordDefinition>Peculiar
   as used in the phrase "peculiar people" in 1 Pet. 2:9, is
   derived from the Lat. peculium, and denotes, as rendered in the
   Revised Version ("a people for God's own possession"), a special
   possession or property. The church is the "property" of God, his
   "purchased possession" (Eph. 1:14; R.V., "God's own
   possession").

      <WordDefinition>Peculiar \Pe*cul"iar\, a. [L. peculiaris, fr. peculium private
   property, akin to pecunia money: cf. OF. peculier. See
   {Pecuniary}.]
   1. One's own; belonging solely or especially to an
      individual; not possessed by others; of private, personal,
      or characteristic possession and use; not owned in common
      or in participation.
      [1913 Webster]

            And purify unto himself a peculiar people. --Titus
                                                  ii. 14.
      [1913 Webster]

            Hymns . . . that Christianity hath peculiar unto
            itself.                               --Hooker.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Particular; individual; special; appropriate.
      [1913 Webster]

            While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat.
                                                  --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

      [1913 Webster]

   3. Unusual; singular; rare; strange; as, the sky had a
      peculiarappearance.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: {Peculiar}, {Special}, {Especial}.

   Usage: Peculiar is from the Roman peculium, which was a thing
          emphatically and distinctively one's own, and hence
          was dear. The former sense always belongs to peculiar
          (as, a peculiar style, peculiar manners, etc.), and
          usually so much of the latter as to involve feelings
          of interest; as, peculiar care, watchfulness,
          satisfaction, etc. Nothing of this kind belongs to
          special and especial. They mark simply the relation of
          species to genus, and denote that there is something
          in this case more than ordinary; as, a special act of
          Congress; especial pains, etc.
          [1913 Webster]

                Beauty, which, either walking or asleep,
                Shot forth peculiar graces.       --Milton.
          [1913 Webster]

                For naught so vile that on the earth doth live,
                But to the earth some special good doth give.
                                                  --Shak.
