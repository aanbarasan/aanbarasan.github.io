        1. &lt;operating system&gt; What {Unix} does when a critical
        internal consistency checks fails in such a way that Unix
        cannot continue.  The {kernel} attempts to print a short
        message on the {console} and write an image of memory into the
        {swap area} on disk.  This can be analysed later using {adb}.
        The kernel will then either wait in a {tight loop} until the
        machine is rebooted or will initiate an automatic {reboot}.
     
        {Unix manual page}: panic(8).
     
        2. Action taken by software which discovers some fatal problem
        which prevents it from continuing to run.
