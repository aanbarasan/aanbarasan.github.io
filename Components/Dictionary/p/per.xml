   2. (Chem.) Originally, denoting that the element to the name
      of which it is prefixed in the respective compounds
      exercised its highest valence; now, only that the element
      has a higher valence than in other similar compounds;
      thus, barium peroxide is the highest oxide of barium;
      while nitrogen and manganese peroxides, so-called, are not
      the highest oxides of those elements.
