        1. &lt;operating system, software&gt; The sequence of states of an

        (which may be shared with other processes which are executing
        the same program), private data, and the state of the

        {child processes}, and {signal handlers}.
     
        One process may, on some {platforms}, consist of many
        {threads}.  A {multitasking} {operating system} can run
        multiple processes {concurrently} or in {parallel}, and allows
        a process to spawn "child" processes.
