      <WordDefinition>Psychic \Psy"chic\, Psychical \Psy"chic*al\, a. [L. psychicus,
   Gr. ?, fr. psychh` the soul, mind; cf. ? to blow: cf. F.
   psychique.]
   1. Of or pertaining to the human soul, or to the living
      principle in man.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: This term was formerly used to express the same idea as
         psychological. Recent metaphysicians, however, have
         employed it to mark the difference between psychh` the
         living principle in man, and pney^ma the rational or
         spiritual part of his nature. In this use, the word
         describes the human soul in its relation to sense,
         appetite, and the outer visible world, as distinguished
         from spiritual or rational faculties, which have to do
         with the supersensible world. --Heyse.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. Of or pertaining to the mind, or its functions and
      diseases; mental; -- contrasted with {physical}.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Psychical blindness}, {Psychical deafness} (Med.), forms of
      nervous disease in which, while the senses of sight and
      hearing remain unimpaired, the mind fails to appreciate
      the significance of the sounds heard or the images seen.
      

   {Psychical contagion}, the transference of disease,
      especially of a functional nervous disease, by mere force
      of example.

   {Psychical medicine}, that department of medicine which
      treats of mental diseases.
      [1913 Webster]
