      <WordDefinition>Politeness \Po*lite"ness\, n.
   1. High finish; smoothness; burnished elegance. [R.]
      --Evelyn.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. The quality or state of being polite; refinement of
      manners; urbanity; courteous behavior; complaisance;
      obliging attentions.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Courtesy; good breeding; refinement; urbanity;
        courteousness; affability; complaisance; civility;
        gentility; courtliness.

   Usage: {Politeness}, {Courtesy}. Politeness denotes that ease
          and gracefulness of manners which first sprung up in
          cities, connected with a desire to please others by
          anticipating their wants and wishes, and studiously
          avoiding whatever might give them pain. Courtesy is,
          etymologically, the politeness of courts. It displays
          itself in the address and manners; it is shown more
          especially in receiving and entertaining others, and
          is a union of dignified complaisance and kindness.
          [1913 Webster]
