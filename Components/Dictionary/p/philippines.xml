   Introduction Philippines
   ------------------------
                            Background: The Philippines were ceded by Spain
                                        to the US in 1898 following the
                                        Spanish-American War. They attained
                                        their independence in 1946 after
                                        Japanese occupation in World War II.
                                        The 21-year rule of Ferdinand MARCOS
                                        ended in 1986 when a widespread
                                        popular rebellion forced him into
                                        exile. In 1992, the US closed its
                                        last military bases on the islands.
                                        The Philippines has had two
                                        electoral presidential transitions
                                        since Marcos' removal by "people
                                        power." In January 2001, the Supreme
                                        Court declared Joseph ESTRADA unable
                                        to rule in view of mass resignations
                                        from his government and administered
                                        the oath of office to Vice President
                                        Gloria MACAPAGAL-ARROYO as his
                                        constitutional successor. The
                                        government continues to struggle
                                        with ongoing Muslim insurgencies in
                                        the south.

   Economy Philippines
   -------------------
                    Economy - overview: In 1998 the Philippine economy - a
                                        mixture of agriculture, light
                                        industry, and supporting services -
                                        deteriorated as a result of
                                        spillover from the Asian financial
                                        crisis and poor weather conditions.
                                        Growth fell to 0.6% in 1998 from 5%
                                        in 1997, but recovered to about 3%
                                        in 1999 and 4% in 2000. The
                                        government has promised to continue
                                        its economic reforms to help the
                                        Philippines match the pace of
                                        development in the newly

                                        Asia. The strategy includes
                                        improving infrastructure,
                                        overhauling the tax system to
                                        bolster government revenues,
                                        furthering deregulation and
