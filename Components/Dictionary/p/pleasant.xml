      <WordDefinition>Pleasant \Pleas"ant\, a. [F. plaisant. See {Please}.]
   1. Pleasing; grateful to the mind or to the senses;
      agreeable; as, a pleasant journey; pleasant weather.
      [1913 Webster]

            Behold, how good and pleasant it is for brethren to
            dwell together in unity!              --Ps. cxxxiii.
                                                  1.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Cheerful; enlivening; gay; sprightly; humorous; sportive;
      as, pleasant company; a pleasant fellow.
      [1913 Webster]

            From grave to light, from pleasant to serve.
                                                  --Dryden.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Pleasing; gratifying; agreeable; cheerful; good-humored;
        enlivening; gay; lively; merry; sportive; humorous;
        jocose; amusing; witty.

   Usage: {Pleasant}, {Pleasing}, {Agreeable}. Agreeable is
          applied to that which agrees with, or is in harmony
          with, one's tastes, character, etc. Pleasant and
          pleasing denote a stronger degree of the agreeable.
          Pleasant refers rather to the state or condition;
          pleasing, to the act or effect. Where they are applied
          to the same object, pleasing is more energetic than
          pleasant; as, she is always pleasant and always
          pleasing. The distinction, however, is not radical and
          not rightly observed.
