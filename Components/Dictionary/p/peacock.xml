      <WordDefinition>Peacock
   (Heb. tuk, apparently borrowed from the Tamil tokei). This bird
   is indigenous to India. It was brought to Solomon by his ships
   from Tarshish (1 Kings 10:22; 2 Chr. 9:21), which in this case
   was probably a district on the Malabar coast of India, or in
   Ceylon. The word so rendered in Job 39:13 literally means wild,
   tumultuous crying, and properly denotes the female ostrich
   (q.v.).

      <WordDefinition>Peacock \Pea"cock`\ (p[=e]"k[o^]k`), n. [OE. pecok. Pea- in this
   word is from AS. pe['a], p[=a]wa, peacock, fr. L. pavo, prob.
   of Oriental origin; cf. Gr. taw`s, taw^s, Per. t[=a]us,
   t[=a]wus, Ar. t[=a]w[=u]s. See {Cock} the bird.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) The male of any pheasant of the genus {Pavo},
      of which at least two species are known, native of
      Southern Asia and the East Indies.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The upper tail coverts, which are long and capable of
         erection, are each marked with a black spot bordered by
         concentric bands of brilliant blue, green, and golden
         colors. The common domesticated species is {Pavo
         cristatus}. The Javan peacock ({Pavo muticus}) is more
         brilliantly colored than the common species.

      brilliant colors. Called also {cook wrasse} and {cook}.
