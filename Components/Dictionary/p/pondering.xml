      <WordDefinition>Ponder \Pon"der\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Pondered}; p. pr. &amp; vb.
   n. {Pondering}.] [L. ponderare, fr. pondus, ponderis, a
   weight, fr. pendere to weigh: cf. F. pond['e]rer. See
   {Pendant}, and cf. {Pound} a weight.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. To weigh. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

   2. To weigh in the mind; to view with deliberation; to
      examine carefully; to consider attentively.
      [1913 Webster]

            Ponder the path of thy feet.          --Prov. iv.
                                                  26.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To {Ponder}, {Consider}, {Muse}.

   Usage: To consider means to view or contemplate with fixed
          thought. To ponder is to dwell upon with long and
          anxious attention, with a view to some practical
          result or decision. To muse is simply to think upon
          continuously with no definite object, or for the
          pleasure it gives. We consider any subject which is
          fairly brought before us; we ponder a concern
          involving great interests; we muse on the events of
          childhood.
