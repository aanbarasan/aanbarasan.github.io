   brotherly love, a city of Lydia in Asia Minor, about 25 miles
   south-east of Sardis. It was the seat of one of the "seven
   churches" (Rev. 3:7-12). It came into the possession of the
   Turks in A.D. 1392. It has several times been nearly destroyed
   by earthquakes. It is still a town of considerable size, called
   Allahshehr, "the city of God."
