   Introduction Poland
   -------------------
                            Background: Poland is an ancient nation that was
                                        conceived around the middle of the
                                        10th century. It's golden age
                                        occurred in the 16th century. During
                                        the following century, the
                                        strengthening of the gentry and
                                        internal disorders weakened the
                                        nation, until an agreement in 1772
                                        between Russia, Prussia, and Austria
                                        partitioned Poland. Poland regained
                                        its independence in 1918 only to be
                                        overrun by Germany and the Soviet
                                        Union in World War II. It became a
                                        Soviet satellite country following
                                        the war, but one that was
                                        comparatively tolerant and
                                        progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980
                                        led to the formation of the
                                        independent trade union "Solidarity"
                                        that over time became a political
                                        force and by 1990 had swept
                                        parliamentary elections and the
                                        presidency. A "shock therapy"
                                        program during the early 1990s
                                        enabled the country to transform its
                                        economy into one of the most robust
                                        in Central Europe, boosting hopes
                                        for acceptance to the EU. Poland
                                        joined the NATO alliance in 1999.

          Environment - current issues: situation has improved since 1989
                                        due to decline in heavy industry and
                                        increased environmental concern by
                                        postcommunist governments; air
                                        pollution nonetheless remains
                                        serious because of sulfur dioxide
                                        emissions from coal-fired power
                                        plants, and the resulting acid rain
                                        has caused forest damage; water
                                        pollution from industrial and
                                        municipal sources is also a problem,

   Economy Poland
   --------------
                    Economy - overview: Poland has steadfastly pursued a
                                        policy of liberalizing the economy
                                        and today stands out as one of the
                                        most successful and open transition
                                        economies. GDP growth had been
                                        strong and steady in 1993-2000 but
                                        fell back in 2001 with slowdowns in
                                        domestic investment and consumption
                                        and the weakening in the global
                                        economy. The privatization of small
                                        and medium state-owned companies and
                                        a liberal law on establishing new
                                        firms have allowed for the rapid
                                        development of a vibrant private
                                        sector. In contrast, Poland's large
                                        agricultural sector remains
                                        handicapped by structural problems,
                                        surplus labor, inefficient small
                                        farms, and lack of investment.
                                        Restructuring and privatization of
                                        "sensitive sectors" (e.g., coal,
                                        steel, railroads, and energy) has
                                        begun. Structural reforms in health
                                        care, education, the pension system,
                                        and state administration have
                                        resulted in larger than expected
                                        fiscal pressures. Further progress
                                        in public finance depends mainly on
