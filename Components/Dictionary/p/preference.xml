      <WordDefinition>PREFERENCE, n.  A sentiment, or frame of mind, induced by the
erroneous belief that one thing is better than another.
    An ancient philosopher, expounding his conviction that life is no
better than death, was asked by a disciple why, then, he did not die. 
"Because," he replied, "death is no better than life."
