      <WordDefinition>Piracy \Pi"ra*cy\, n.; pl. {Piracies}. [Cf. LL. piratia, Gr. ?.
   See {Pirate}.]
   1. The act or crime of a pirate.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Common Law) Robbery on the high seas; the taking of
      property from others on the open sea by open violence;
      without lawful authority, and with intent to steal; -- a
      crime answering to robbery on land.
      [1913 Webster]
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: By statute law several other offenses committed on the
         seas (as trading with known pirates, or engaging in the
         slave trade) have been made piracy.
         [1913 Webster]

   3. ``Sometimes used, in a quasi-figurative sense, of
      violation of copyright; but for this, infringement is the
      correct and preferable term.'' --Abbott.
      [1913 Webster]
