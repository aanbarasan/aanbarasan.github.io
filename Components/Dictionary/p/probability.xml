      <WordDefinition>Probability \Prob`a*bil"i*ty\, n.; pl. {Probabilities}. [L.

   [1913 Webster]
   1. The quality or state of being probable; appearance of
      reality or truth; reasonable ground of presumption;
      likelihood.
      [1913 Webster]

            Probability is the appearance of the agreement or
            disagreement of two ideas, by the intervention of
            proofs whose connection is not constant, but appears
            for the most part to be so.           --Locke.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. That which is or appears probable; anything that has the
      appearance of reality or truth.
      [1913 Webster]

            The whole life of man is a perpetual comparison of
            evidence and balancing of probabilities.
                                                  --Buckminster.
      [1913 Webster]

            We do not call for evidence till antecedent
            probabilities fail.                   --J. H.
                                                  Newman.
