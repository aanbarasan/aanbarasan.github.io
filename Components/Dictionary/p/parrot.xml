   Cf. {Paroquet}, {Petrel}, {Petrify}.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) In a general sense, any bird of the order
      {Psittaci}.

      {Pionus}, and other genera of the family {Psittacid[ae]},
      as distinguished from the parrakeets, macaws, and lories.
      They have a short rounded or even tail, and often a naked

      examples. Many species, as cage birds, readily learn to
      imitate sounds, and to repeat words and phrases.
