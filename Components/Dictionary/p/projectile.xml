      <WordDefinition>PROJECTILE, n.  The final arbiter in international disputes.  Formerly
these disputes were settled by physical contact of the disputants,
with such simple arguments as the rudimentary logic of the times could
supply -- the sword, the spear, and so forth.  With the growth of
prudence in military affairs the projectile came more and more into
favor, and is now held in high esteem by the most courageous.  Its
capital defect is that it requires personal attendance at the point of
propulsion.
