      <WordDefinition>push [from the operation that puts the current information on a stack,
   and the fact that procedure return addresses are saved on a stack] (Also
   PUSH /push/ or PUSHJ /push'J/, the latter based on the PDP-10 procedure
   call instruction.) 1. To put something onto a {stack} or {PDL}. If one
   says that something has been pushed onto one's stack, it means that the
   Damoclean list of things hanging over ones's head has grown longer and
   heavier yet. This may also imply that one will deal with it _before_
   other pending items; otherwise one might say that the thing was `added
   to my queue'. 2. vi. To enter upon a digression, to save the current
   discussion for later. Antonym of {pop}; see also {stack}, {PDL}.
