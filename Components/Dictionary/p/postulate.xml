      <WordDefinition>Postulate \Pos"tu*late\, n. [L. postulatum a demand, request,
   prop. p. p. of postulare to demand, prob. a dim. of poscere
   to demand, prob. for porcscere; akin to G. forschen to
   search, investigate, Skr. prach to ask, and L. precari to
   pray: cf. F. postulat. See {Pray}.]
   1. Something demanded or asserted; especially, a position or
      supposition assumed without proof, or one which is
      considered as self-evident; a truth to which assent may be
      demanded or challenged, without argument or evidence.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Geom.) The enunciation of a self-evident problem, in
      distinction from an axiom, which is the enunciation of a
      self-evident theorem.
      [1913 Webster]

            The distinction between a postulate and an axiom
            lies in this, -- that the latter is admitted to be
            self-evident, while the former may be agreed upon
            between two reasoners, and admitted by both, but not
            as proposition which it would be impossible to deny.
                                                  --Eng. Cyc.
