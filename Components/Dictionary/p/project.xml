   Syn: Design; scheme; plan; purpose.

   Usage: {Project}, {Design}. A project is something of a

          its being done. A design is a project when matured and
          settled, as a thing to be accomplished. An ingenious
          man has many projects, but, if governed by sound
          sense, will be slow in forming them into designs. See
          also {Scheme}.
