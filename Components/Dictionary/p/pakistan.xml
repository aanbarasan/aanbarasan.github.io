         Economic overview: Pakistan is a poor, highly populated
         Third World country struggling to make the difficult
         transition to the modern world of high technology and
         internationalized markets. Prime Minister Benazir
         BHUTTO has been under pressure from the IMF and other
         donors to continue the economic reforms and austerity
         measures begun by her predecessor, caretaker Prime
         Minister Moeen QURESHI (July-October 1993). The IMF
         suspended a $1.5 billion Enhanced Structural Adjustment
         Facility (ESAF) in mid-1995 because Pakistan slowed the
         pace of economic reform. Islamabad's most recent budget
         -- announced in June 1995 -- reversed some reforms
         agreed to by the IMF earlier that year, including a
         slowing of tariff reform. In mid-December 1995,
         however, the IMF approved a $600 million standby
         arrangement and urged Pakistan to move forward with
         economic liberalization. Islamabad has agreed to new
         economic targets with the IMF, which could lay the
         basis for a return to an ESAF in 1996. Little progress
         was made in the privatization of large state-owned
         units in 1995. The sale of the power plant Kot Addu -
         scheduled for April 1995 - was stalled by opposition
         from labor unions. The sale of a 26% share of United
         Bank Limited and the Pakistan Telecommunications
         Corporation to strategic investors was due to take
         place in 1995 but has been pushed back to 1996. On the
         plus side real GDP grew 4.7% in 1995, up from 3.9% in
         1994: GDP should grow even faster in 1996 as a result
         of an above average cotton crop. Secondly, Islamabad
         reduced the budget deficit to 5.6% of GDP at the end of
         FY94/95, down from 8% two years earlier. Thirdly,
         Pakistan attracted $1.6 billion in foreign direct and
         portfolio investment in FY94/95, more than double
         inflows of $650 million in the previous fiscal year;
         financial agreements were reached on five power
         projects in 1995, including the 1,300-MW $1.8 billion
         Hab River project. Despite these improvements, the
         economy remains vulnerable to crisis. Foreign exchange
         reserves fell dramatically in 1995, reaching a low of
         about $1 billion in early December 1995 -- only five
         weeks of import cover -- before rising to $1.5 billion
         by yearend. The trade deficit rose to $2 billion for
         the first six months of FY94/95, triple the deficit of
         $600 million during the same period in FY93/94. The
         government responded to this situation with a package
         of stabilization reforms on 28 October 1995 which
         included a 7% devaluation of the rupee, supplementary
         duties of 10% on many imports, and higher petroleum
         prices. Islamabad hopes these moves will help make its
         exports more competitive. For the long run, Pakistan
         must deal with serious problems of deteriorating
         infrastructure, low literacy levels, and persistent law
         and order problems in Karachi. GDP: purchasing power

   Introduction Pakistan
   ---------------------
                            Background: The separation in 1947 of British
                                        India into the Muslim state of
                                        Pakistan (with two sections West and
                                        East) and largely Hindu India was
                                        never satisfactorily resolved. A
                                        third war between these countries in
                                        1971 resulted in East Pakistan
                                        seceding and becoming the separate
                                        nation of Bangladesh. A dispute over
                                        the state of Kashmir is ongoing. In
                                        response to Indian nuclear weapons
                                        testing, Pakistan conducted its own
                                        tests in 1998.

                    Economy - overview: Pakistan, an impoverished and
                                        underdeveloped country, suffers from
                                        internal political disputes, lack of
                                        foreign investment, and a costly
                                        confrontation with neighboring
                                        India. Pakistan's economic
                                        prospects, marred by poor human
                                        development indicators, low levels
                                        of foreign investment, and reliance
                                        on international creditors for hard
                                        currency inflows, were nonetheless
                                        on an upswing through most of 2001.
                                        The MUSHARRAF government made
                                        significant inroads in macroeconomic
                                        reform - it completed an IMF short-
                                        term loan program for the first time
                                        and improved its standing with
                                        international creditors by
                                        increasing revenue collection and
                                        restraining the fiscal deficit in
                                        the 2001/02 budget. While Pakistan
                                        has capitalized on its international
                                        standing after the 11 September
                                        terrorist attacks on the US by
                                        garnering substantial assistance
                                        from abroad - including $1.3 billion
                                        in IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth
                                        Facility aid and $12.5 billion in
                                        Paris Club debt rescheduling - long-
                                        term prospects remain uncertain. GDP
                                        growth will continue to hinge on
                                        crop performance; dependence on
                                        foreign oil leaves the import bill
                                        vulnerable to fluctuating oil
                                        prices; and foreign and domestic
                                        investors remain wary of committing
                                        to projects in Pakistan. Pakistani
                                        trade levels - already in decline
                                        due to the global economic downturn
                                        - worsened in the aftermath of the
                                        September 11 attacks.
