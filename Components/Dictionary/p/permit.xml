      <WordDefinition>Permit \Per*mit"\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Permitted}; p. pr. &amp; vb.

      [1913 Webster]

   2. To grant (one) express license or liberty to do an act; to
      authorize; to give leave; -- followed by an infinitive.
      [1913 Webster]

                                                  xxvi. 1.

      [1913 Webster]

            But to the gods permit the event of things.
                                                  --Addison.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To allow; let; grant; admit; suffer; tolerate; endure;
        consent to.

   Usage: To {Allow}, {Permit}, {Suffer}, {Tolerate}. To allow
          is more positive, denoting (at least originally and
          etymologically) a decided assent, either directly or
          by implication. To permit is more negative, and
          imports only acquiescence or an abstinence from
          prevention. The distinction, however, is often
          disregarded by good writers. To suffer has a stronger
          passive or negative sense than to permit, sometimes
          implying against the will, sometimes mere
          indifference. To tolerate is to endure what is
          contrary to will or desire. To suffer and to tolerate
          are sometimes used without discrimination.
