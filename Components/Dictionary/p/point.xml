        1. &lt;unit, text&gt; (Sometimes abbreviated "pt") The unit of
        length for {text} {characters}.  There are six slightly
        different definitions: {Truchet point}, {Didot point}, {ATA
        point}, {TeX point}, {Postscript point}, and {IN point}.
     
        The most commonly used are ATA in the USA and Didot in Europe.
     
        A {twip} is 1/20 of a PostScript[?] point.

        2. &lt;hardware&gt; To move a {pointing device} so that the
        on-screen pointer is positioned over a certain object on the
        screen such as a {button} in a {graphical user interface}.  In
        most {window systems} it is then necessary to {click} a
        (physical) button on the pointing device to activate or select
        the object.  In some systems, just pointing to an object is
        known as "mouse-over" {event} which may cause some help text
        (called a "tool tip" in {Windows}) to be displayed.
