   Syn: Mask; appearance; color; show; pretext; excuse.

   Usage: {Pretense}, {Pretext}. A pretense is something held
          out as real when it is not so, thus falsifying the
          truth. A pretext is something woven up in order to
          cover or conceal one's true motives, feelings, or
          reasons. Pretext is often, but not always, used in a
          bad sense.
          [1913 Webster]
