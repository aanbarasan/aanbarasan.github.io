      <WordDefinition>Pepper \Pep"per\, n. [OE. peper, AS. pipor, L. piper, fr. Gr. ?,
   ?, akin to Skr. pippala, pippali.]
   1. A well-known, pungently aromatic condiment, the dried
      berry, either whole or powdered, of the {Piper nigrum}.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Common, or black, pepper is made from the whole berry,
         dried just before maturity; white pepper is made from
         the ripe berry after the outer skin has been removed by
         maceration and friction. It has less of the peculiar
         properties of the plant than the black pepper. Pepper
         is used in medicine as a carminative stimulant.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. (Bot.) The plant which yields pepper, an East Indian woody
      climber ({Piper nigrum}), with ovate leaves and apetalous
      flowers in spikes opposite the leaves. The berries are red
      when ripe. Also, by extension, any one of the several
      hundred species of the genus {Piper}, widely dispersed
      throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the
      earth.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Any plant of the genus Capsicum, and its fruit; red
      pepper; as, the bell pepper.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The term pepper has been extended to various other
         fruits and plants, more or less closely resembling the
         true pepper, esp. to the common varieties of
         {Capsicum}. See {Capsicum}, and the Phrases, below.
