      <WordDefinition>Pavement
   It was the custom of the Roman governors to erect their
   tribunals in open places, as the market-place, the circus, or
   even the highway. Pilate caused his seat of judgment to be set
   down in a place called "the Pavement" (John 19:13) i.e., a place
   paved with a mosaic of coloured stones. It was probably a place
   thus prepared in front of the "judgment hall." (See {GABBATHA}.)
