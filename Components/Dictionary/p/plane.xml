      <WordDefinition>Plane \Plane\, n. [F., fr. L. platanus, Gr. ?, fr. ? broad; --
   so called on account of its broad leaves and spreading form.
   See {Place}, and cf. {Platane}, {Plantain} the tree.] (Bot.)
   Any tree of the genus {Platanus}.

   Note: The Oriental plane ({Platanus orientalis}) is a native
         of Asia. It rises with a straight, smooth, branching
         stem to a great height, with palmated leaves, and long
         pendulous peduncles, sustaining several heads of small
         close-sitting flowers. The seeds are downy, and
         collected into round, rough, hard balls. The Occidental
         plane ({Platanus occidentalis}), which grows to a great
         height, is a native of North America, where it is
         popularly called {sycamore}, {buttonwood}, and
         {buttonball}, names also applied to the California
         species ({Platanus racemosa}).

      <WordDefinition>Plane \Plane\, n. [F. plane, L. plana. See {Plane}, v. &amp; a.]
   1. (Geom.) A surface, real or imaginary, in which, if any two
      points are taken, the straight line which joins them lies
      wholly in that surface; or a surface, any section of which
      by a like surface is a straight line; a surface without
      curvature.

      wood, for forming moldings, etc. It consists of a
      smooth-soled stock, usually of wood, from the under side

      of a chisel, called the iron, which inclines backward,
      with an apperture in front for the escape of shavings; as,
      the jack plane; the smoothing plane; the molding plane,
      etc.
      [1913 Webster]

      infinitely distant are conceived as situated.

   {Plane of projection}.
      (a) The plane on which the projection is made,
          corresponding to the perspective plane in perspective;
          -- called also principal plane.
      (b) (Descriptive Geom.) One of the planes to which points
          are referred for the purpose of determining their
          relative position in space.

      or reflected ray.

   2. To efface or remove.
      [1913 Webster]

      <WordDefinition>aeroplane \aer"*o*plane`\ aeroplane \a"["e]r*o*plane`\, n.
   [a["e]ro- + plane.] (A["e]ronautics)
   1. A light rigid plane used in a["e]rial navigation to oppose
      sudden upward or downward movement in the air, as in
      gliding machines; specif., such a plane slightly inclined
      and driven forward as a lifting device in some flying
      machines. Also called {airfoil}.
      [Webster 1913 Suppl.]

   2. hence, a heavier-than-air flying machine using such a
      device to provide lift. In a modern aeroplane, the
      airfoils are called the {wings}, and most of the lift is
      derived from these surfaces. In contrast to helicopters,
      the wings are fixed to the passenger compartment
      (airframe) and do not move relative to the frame; thus
      such a machine is called a {fixed-wing aircraft}. These
      machines are called monoplanes, biplanes, triplanes, or
      quadruplanes, according to the number of main supporting
      planes (wings) used in their construction. After 1940 few
      planes with more than one airfoil were constructed, and
      these are used by hobbyists or for special purposes. Being
      heavier than air they depend for their levitation on
      motion imparted by the thrust from either propellers
      driven by an engine, or, in a jet plane, by the reaction
      from a high-velocity stream of gases expelled rearward
      from a jet engine. They start from the ground by a run on
      small wheels or runners, and are guided by a steering
      apparatus consisting of horizontal and vertical movable
      planes, which usually form part of the wings or tail.
      There are many varieties of form and construction, which
      in some cases are known by the names of their inventors.
      In U.S., an aeroplane is usually called an {airplane} or
      {plane}.
