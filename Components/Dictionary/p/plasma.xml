      <WordDefinition>PLASMA
     
        PLAnner-like System Modelled on Actors.  {Carl Hewitt}, 1975.
        The first {actor} language.  Originally called Planner-73, and
        implemented in MacLisp.  Lisp-like syntax, but with several
        kinds of parentheses and brackets.

      <WordDefinition>Plasma \Plas"ma\, n. [See {Plasm}.]
   1. (Min.) A variety of quartz, of a color between grass green
      and leek green, which is found associated with common
      chalcedony. It was much esteemed by the ancients for
      making engraved ornaments.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Biol.) The viscous material of an animal or vegetable
      cell, out of which the various tissues are formed by a
      process of differentiation; protoplasm.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Unorganized material; elementary matter.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. (Med.) A mixture of starch and glycerin, used as a
      substitute for ointments. --U. S. Disp.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. same as {blood plasma}.
      [PJC]

   6. (physics) a state of matter in which charged particles
      such as electrons and atomi nuclei have sufficiently high
      energy to move freely, rather than be bound in atoms as in
      ordinary matter; it has some of the properties of a gas,
      but is a conductor of electricity.

   Note: In a typical plasma, the number of positive and
         negative particles are approximately equal. Plasmas are
         found naturally in the atmosphere of stars, and can be
         created in special laboratory apparatus.
         [PJC]

   {Blood plasma} (Physiol.), the colorless fluid of the blood,
      in which the red and white blood corpuscles are suspended.
      It may be obtained by centrifuation of blood to remove the
      blood cells. It is distinguished from {serum} in that
      plasma still has the fibrin of blood, and may be clotted,
      while in serum the fibrin has been removed.

   {Muscle plasma} (Physiol.), the fundamental part of muscle
      fibers, a thick, viscid, albuminous fluid contained within
      the sarcolemma, which on the death of the muscle
      coagulates to a semisolid mass.
      [1913 Webster +PJC]

      <WordDefinition>plasma
     n 1: colorless watery fluid of blood and lymph containing no
          cells and in which erythrocytes and leukocytes and
          platelets are suspended [syn: {plasm}]
     2: a green slightly translucent variety of chalcedony used as a
        gemstone
     3: (physical chemistry) a fourth state of matter distinct from
        solid or liquid or gas and present in stars and fusion
        reactors; a gas becomes a plasma when it is heated until
        the atoms lose all their electrons, leaving a highly
        electrified collection of nuclei and free electrons;
        "particles in space exist in the form of a plasma"
