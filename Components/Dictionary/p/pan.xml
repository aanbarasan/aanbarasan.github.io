      <WordDefinition>Pan
   a vessel of metal or earthenware used in culinary operations; a
   cooking-pan or frying-pan frequently referred to in the Old
   Testament (Lev. 2:5; 6:21; Num. 11:8; 1 Sam. 2:14, etc.).
   
     The "ash-pans" mentioned in Ex. 27:3 were made of copper, and
   were used in connection with the altar of burnt-offering. The
   "iron pan" mentioned in Ezek. 4:3 (marg., "flat plate " or
   "slice") was probably a mere plate of iron used for baking. The
   "fire-pans" of Ex. 27:3 were fire-shovels used for taking up
   coals. The same Hebrew word is rendered "snuff-dishes" (25:38;
   37:23) and "censers" (Lev. 10:1; 16:12; Num. 4:14, etc.). These
   were probably simply metal vessels employed for carrying burning
   embers from the brazen altar to the altar of incense.
   
     The "frying-pan" mentioned in Lev. 2:7; 7:9 was a pot for
   boiling.
