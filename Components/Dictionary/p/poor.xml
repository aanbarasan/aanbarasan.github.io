      <WordDefinition>Poor
   The Mosaic legislation regarding the poor is specially
   important. (1.) They had the right of gleaning the fields (Lev.
   19:9, 10; Deut. 24:19,21).
   
     (2.) In the sabbatical year they were to have their share of
   the produce of the fields and the vineyards (Ex. 23:11; Lev.
   25:6).
   
     (3.) In the year of jubilee they recovered their property
   (Lev. 25:25-30).
   
     (4.) Usury was forbidden, and the pledged raiment was to be
   returned before the sun went down (Ex. 22:25-27; Deut.
   24:10-13). The rich were to be generous to the poor (Deut.
   15:7-11).
   
     (5.) In the sabbatical and jubilee years the bond-servant was
   to go free (Deut. 15:12-15; Lev. 25:39-42, 47-54).
   
     (6.) Certain portions from the tithes were assigned to the
   poor (Deut. 14:28, 29; 26:12, 13).
   
     (7.) They shared in the feasts (Deut. 16:11, 14; Neh. 8:10).
   
     (8.) Wages were to be paid at the close of each day (Lev.
   19:13).
   
     In the New Testament (Luke 3:11; 14:13; Acts 6:1; Gal. 2:10;
   James 2:15, 16) we have similar injunctions given with reference
   to the poor. Begging was not common under the Old Testament,
   while it was so in the New Testament times (Luke 16:20, 21,
   etc.). But begging in the case of those who are able to work is
   forbidden, and all such are enjoined to "work with their own
   hands" as a Christian duty (1 Thess. 4:11; 2 Thess. 3:7-13; Eph.
   4:28). This word is used figuratively in Matt. 5:3; Luke 6:20; 2
   Cor. 8:9; Rev. 3:17.
