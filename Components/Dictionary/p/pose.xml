      <WordDefinition>Pose \Pose\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Posed}; p. pr. &amp; vb. n.
   {Posing}.] [F. poser to place, to put, L. pausare to pause,
   in LL. also, to place, put, fr. L. pausa a pause, Gr. ?, fr.
   ? to make to cease, prob. akin to E. few. In compounds, this
   word appears corresponding to L. ponere to put, place, the
   substitution in French having been probably due to confusion
   of this word with L. positio position, fr. ponere. See {Few},
   and cf. {Appose}, {Dispose}, {Oppose}, {Pause}, {Repose},
   {Position}.]
   To place in an attitude or fixed position, for the sake of
   effect; to arrange the posture and drapery of (a person) in a
   studied manner; as, to pose a model for a picture; to pose a
   sitter for a portrait.
