      <WordDefinition>Portrait \Por"trait\, n. [F., originally p. p. of portraire to
   portray. See {Portray}.]
   1. The likeness of a person, painted, drawn, or engraved;
      commonly, a representation of the human face painted from
      real life.
      [1913 Webster]

            In portraits, the grace, and, we may add, the
            likeness, consists more in the general air than in
            the exact similitude of every feature. --Sir J.
                                                  Reynolds.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The meaning of the word is sometimes extended so as to
         include a photographic likeness.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. Hence, any graphic or vivid delineation or description of
      a person; as, a portrait in words.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Portrait bust}, or {Portrait statue}, a bust or statue
      representing the actual features or person of an
      individual; -- in distinction from an ideal bust or
      statue.
      [1913 Webster]
