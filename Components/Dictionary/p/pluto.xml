      <WordDefinition>Pluto \Plu"to\, [Also spelled {rop. .]n. [L., fr. Gr. ?.]
   1. (Class. Myth.) The son of Saturn and Rhea, brother of
      Jupiter and Neptune; the dark and gloomy god of the Lower
      World.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. The ninth planet of the Solar System, the smallest (5700
      km radius) and most distant from the sun. The suggestion
      has been made that it more closely resembles a large close
      comet than a planet. Its orbit has an eccentricity of
      0.248, larger than that of any other planet; it varies
      from 4.44 to 7.37 billion km distance from the sun.
      [PJC]

            Pluto is an oddball among its eight sister planets.
            It's the smallest in both size and mass, and has the
            most elliptical orbit. It moves in a plane tilted
            markedly away from the other planets' orbits.
            Moreover, Pluto is the only planet made almost
            entirely of ice.                      --Ron Cohen
