      <WordDefinition>port
     
        1. &lt;networking&gt; A logical channel or channel endpoint in a
        communications system.  The {Transmission Control Protocol}
        and {User Datagram Protocol} {transport layer} protocols used
        on {Ethernet} use port numbers to distinguish between
        (demultiplex) different logical channels on the same {network
        interface} on the same computer.
     
        Each {application program} has a unique port number associated
        with it, defined in /etc/services or the {Network Information
        Service} "services" database.  Some {protocols}, e.g. {telnet}
        and {HTTP} (which is actually a special form of telnet) have
        default ports specified as above but can use other ports as
        well.
     
        Some port numbers are defined in {RFC 1700}, divided into
        {well-known ports} and {registered ports}.
     
        2. &lt;operating system, programming&gt; To translate or modify
        {software} to run on a different {platform}, or the results of
        doing so.  The {portability} of the software determines how
        easy it is to port.
     
        3. &lt;language&gt; An {imperative} language descended from {Zed}
        from {Waterloo Microsystems} (now {Hayes} Canada) ca. 1979.

      <WordDefinition>Larboard \Lar"board`\, n. [Lar- is of uncertain origin, possibly
   the same as lower, i. e., humbler in rank, because the
   starboard side is considered by mariners as higher in rank;
   cf. D. laag low, akin to E. low. See {Board}, n., 8.] (Naut.)
   The left-hand side of a ship to one on board facing toward
   the bow; port; -- opposed to {starboard}.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Larboard is a nearly obsolete term, having been
         superseded by {port} to avoid liability of confusion
         with starboard, owing to similarity of sound.
