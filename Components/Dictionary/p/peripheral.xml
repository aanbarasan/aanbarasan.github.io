      <WordDefinition>peripheral
     
        &lt;hardware&gt; (Or "peripheral device", "device") Any part of a
        computer other than the {CPU} or {working memory},
        i.e. {disks}, {keyboards}, {monitors}, {mice}, {printers},
        {scanners}, {tape drives}, {microphones}, {speakers},
        {cameras}, to list just the less exotic ones.
     
        High speed working {memory}, such as {RAM}, {ROM} or, in the
        old days, {core} would not normally be referred to as
        peripherals.  The more modern term "device" is also more
        general in that it is used for things such as a {pseudo-tty},
        a {RAM drive}, or a {network adaptor}.
     
        Some argue that, since the advent of the {personal computer},
        the {motherboard}, {hard disk}, keyboard, mouse, and monitor
        are all parts of the base system, and only use the term
        "peripheral" for optional additional components.
