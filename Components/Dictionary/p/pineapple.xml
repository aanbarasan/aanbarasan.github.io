      <WordDefinition>fragmentation grenade \fragmentation grenade\ n. (Mil.)
   A type of hand grenade designed to burst into multiple
   fragments upon detonation of the explosive charge; the
   fragments fly away at high velocity, killing or wounding
   persons nearby. Contrasted to {concussion grenade}. The
   common type of fragmentation grenade used by the American
   military was sometimes jocosely referred to as a {pineapple}
   from its reticulated surface appearance, resembling that of
   the fruit.
