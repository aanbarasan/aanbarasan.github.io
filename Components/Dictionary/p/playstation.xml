      <WordDefinition>Playstation
     
        &lt;games, hardware&gt; The leading family of {games consoles}, from
        {Sony Corporation} consisting of the original Playstation
        (PS1) and the Playstation 2 (PS2).
     
        The basic Playstations consist of a small box containing the
        processor and a {DVD} reader, with video outputs to connect to
        a TV, sockets for two game controllers, and a socket for one
        or two memory cards.  The PS2 also has {USB} sockets.
     
        The PS2 can run PS1 software because the PS2's I/O processor
        is the same as the PS1's CPU.
