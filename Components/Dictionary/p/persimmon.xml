      <WordDefinition>Persimmon \Per*sim"mon\, n. [Virginia Indian.] (Bot.)
   An American tree ({Diospyros Virginiana}) and its fruit,
   found from New York southward. The fruit is like a plum in
   appearance, but is very harsh and astringent until it has
   been exposed to frost, when it becomes palatable and
   nutritious.
   [1913 Webster]

   {Japanese persimmon}, {Diospyros Kaki} and its red or yellow
      edible fruit, which outwardly resembles a tomato, but
      contains a few large seeds.
