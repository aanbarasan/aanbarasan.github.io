      <WordDefinition>Pea \Pea\, n.; pl. {Peas}or {Pease}. [OE. pese, fr. AS. pisa, or
   OF. peis, F. pois; both fr. L. pisum; cf. Gr. ?, ?. The final
   s was misunderstood in English as a plural ending. Cf.
   {Pease}.]
   1. (Bot.) A plant, and its fruit, of the genus {Pisum}, of
      many varieties, much cultivated for food. It has a
      papilionaceous flower, and the pericarp is a legume,
      popularly called a pod.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: When a definite number, more than one, is spoken of,
         the plural form peas is used; as, the pod contained
         nine peas; but, in a collective sense, the form pease
         is preferred; as, a bushel of pease; they had pease at
         dinner. This distinction is not always preserved, the
         form peas being used in both senses.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. A name given, especially in the Southern States, to the
      seed of several leguminous plants (species of {Dolichos},
      {Cicer}, {Abrus}, etc.) esp. those having a scar (hilum)
      of a different color from the rest of the seed.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The name pea is given to many leguminous plants more or
         less closely related to the common pea. See the
