      <WordDefinition>patch
     
        &lt;software&gt; 1. A temporary addition to a piece of code, usually
        as a {quick-and-dirty} remedy to an existing {bug} or
        {misfeature}.  A patch may or may not work, and may or may not
        eventually be incorporated permanently into the program.
        Distinguished from a {diff} or {mod} by the fact that a patch
        is generated by more primitive means than the rest of the
        program; the classical examples are instructions modified by
        using the front panel switches, and changes made directly to
        the binary executable of a program originally written in an
        {HLL}.  Compare {one-line fix}.
     
        2. To insert a patch into a piece of code.
     
        3. [in the Unix world] A {diff}.
     
        4. A set of modifications to binaries to be applied by a
        patching program.  {IBM} systems often receive updates to the
        {operating system} in the form of absolute {hexadecimal}
        patches.  If you have modified your OS, you have to
        disassemble these back to the {source code}.  The patches
        might later be corrected by other patches on top of them
        (patches were said to "grow scar tissue").  The result was
        often a convoluted {patch space} and headaches galore.
     
        There is a classic story of a {tiger team} penetrating a
        secure military computer that illustrates the danger inherent
        in binary patches (or, indeed, any patches that you can't - or
        don't - inspect and examine before installing).  They couldn't
        find any {trap doors} or any way to penetrate security of
        IBM's OS, so they made a site visit to an IBM office
        (remember, these were official military types who were
        purportedly on official business), swiped some IBM stationery,
        and created a fake patch.  The patch was actually the trapdoor
        they needed.  The patch was distributed at about the right
        time for an IBM patch, had official stationery and all
        accompanying documentation, and was dutifully installed.  The
        installation manager very shortly thereafter learned something
        about proper procedures.
     
        5. {Larry Wall}'s "patch" utility, which automatically applies
        a patch to a set of {source code} or other text files.  It
        accepts input in any of the four forms output by the {Unix}
        {diff} utility and uses many helpful {heuristics} to determine
        how to apply them.
     
        Diff and patch are the standard way of producing and applying
        updates to {Unix} files ditributed via {Usenet} and the
        {Internet}, both have been ported to other {operating
        systems}.
     
        See your nearest {GNU archive site}.
