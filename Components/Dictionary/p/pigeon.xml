   Pigeons are mentioned as among the offerings which, by divine
   appointment, Abram presented unto the Lord (Gen. 15:9). They
   were afterwards enumerated among the sin-offerings (Lev. 1:14;
   12:6), and the law provided that those who could not offer a
   lamb might offer two young pigeons (5:7; comp. Luke 2:24). (See {DOVE}.)

      <WordDefinition>Pigeon \Pi"geon\, n. [F., fr. L. pipio a young pipping or
   chirping bird, fr. pipire to peep, chirp. Cf. {Peep} to
   chirp.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) Any bird of the order Columb[ae], of which
      numerous species occur in nearly all parts of the world.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The common domestic pigeon, or dove, was derived from
         the Old World rock pigeon or rock dove ({Columba
         livia}), common in cities. It has given rise to
         numerous very remarkable varieties, such as the
         carrier, fantail, nun, pouter, tumbler, etc. The common
         wild pigeon of the Eastern United States is the
         {Mourning dove} ({Zenaida macroura}, called also
         {Carolina dove}). Before the 19th century, the most
         common pigeon was the passenger pigeon, but that
         species is now extinct. See {Passenger pigeon}, and
         {Carolina dove} under {Dove}. See, also, {Fruit
         pigeon}, {Ground pigeon}, {Queen pigeon}, {Stock
         pigeon}, under {Fruit}, {Ground}, etc.
