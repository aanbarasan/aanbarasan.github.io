      <WordDefinition>pumpkin
     
        &lt;jargon&gt; A humourous term for the {token} - the object
        (notional or real) that gives its possessor (the "pumpking" or
        the "pumpkineer") exclusive access to something, e.g. applying
        {patches} to a master copy of {source} (for which the pumpkin
        is called a "patch pumpkin").

        David Croy once told me once that at a previous job, there was
        one tape drive and multiple systems that used it for backups.
        But instead of some high-tech exclusion software, they used a
        low-tech method to prevent multiple simultaneous backups: a
        stuffed pumpkin.  No one was allowed to make backups unless
        they had the "backup pumpkin".
