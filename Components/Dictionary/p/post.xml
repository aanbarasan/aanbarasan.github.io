      <WordDefinition>Post
   (1.) A runner, or courier, for the rapid transmission of
   letters, etc. (2 Chr. 30:6; Esther 3:13, 15; 8:10, 14; Job 9:25;
   Jer. 51:31). Such messengers were used from very early times.
   Those employed by the Hebrew kings had a military character (1
   Sam. 22:17; 2 Kings 10:25, "guard," marg. "runners"). The modern
   system of postal communication was first established by Louis
   XI. of France in A.D. 1464.
   
     (2.) This word sometimes also is used for lintel or threshold
   (Isa. 6:4).

      <WordDefinition>post
     
        &lt;messaging&gt; To send a message to a {mailing list} or
        {newsgroup}.  Usually implies that the message is sent
        indiscriminately to multiple users, in contrast to "mail"
        which implies one or more deliberately selected individual
        recipients.
     
        You should only post a message if you think it will be of
        interest to a significant proportion of the readers of the
        group or list, otherwise you should use private {electronic
        mail} instead.  See {netiquette}.
