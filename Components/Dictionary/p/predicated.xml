      <WordDefinition>Predicate \Pred"i*cate\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Predicated}; p.
   pr. &amp; vb. n. {Predicating}.] [L. praedicatus, p. p. of
   praedicare to cry in public, to proclaim. See {Preach}.]
   1. To assert to belong to something; to affirm (one thing of
      another); as, to predicate whiteness of snow.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. To found; to base. [U.S.]
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Predicate is sometimes used in the United States for
         found or base; as, to predicate an argument on certain
         principles; to predicate a statement on information
         received. Predicate is a term in logic, and used only
         in a single case, namely, when we affirm one thing of
         another. ``Similitude is not predicated of essences or
         substances, but of figures and qualities only.''
         --Cudworth.
         [1913 Webster]
