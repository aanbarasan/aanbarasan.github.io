      <WordDefinition>Physician
   Asa, afflicted with some bodily malady, "sought not to the Lord
   but to the physicians" (2 Chr. 16:12). The "physicians" were
   those who "practised heathen arts of magic, disavowing
   recognized methods of cure, and dissociating the healing art
   from dependence on the God of Israel. The sin of Asa was not,
   therefore, in seeking medical advice, as we understand the
   phrase, but in forgetting Jehovah."
