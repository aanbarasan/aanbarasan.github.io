      <WordDefinition>Pound \Pound\, n.; pl. {Pounds}, collectively {Pound} or
   {Pounds}. [AS. pund, fr. L. pondo, akin to pondus a weight,
   pendere to weigh. See {Pendant}.]
   1. A certain specified weight; especially, a legal standard
      consisting of an established number of ounces.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The pound in general use in the United States and in
         England is the pound avoirdupois, which is divided into
         sixteen ounces, and contains 7,000 grains. The pound
         troy is divided into twelve ounces, and contains 5,760
         grains. 144 pounds avoirdupois are equal to 175 pounds
         troy weight. See {Avoirdupois}, and {Troy}.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. A British denomination of money of account, equivalent to
      twenty shillings sterling, and equal in value to about
      $4.86. There is no coin known by this name, but the gold
      sovereign is of the same value.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The pound sterling was in Saxon times, about a. d. 671,
         a pound troy of silver, and a shilling was its
         twentieth part; consequently the latter was three times
         as large as it is at present. --Peacham.
