   Jezebel "painted her face" (2 Kings 9:30); and the practice of
   painting the face and the eyes seems to have been common (Jer.
   4:30; Ezek. 23:40). An allusion to this practice is found in the
   name of Job's daughter (42:14) Kerenhappuch (q.v.). Paintings in
   the modern sense of the word were unknown to the ancient Jews.
