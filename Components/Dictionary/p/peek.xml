      <WordDefinition>PEEK
     
        The command in most {microcomputer} {BASIC}s for reading
        memory contents (a byte) at an absolute address.  POKE is the
        corresponding command to write a value to an absolute address.
     
        This is often extended to mean the corresponding constructs in
        any {High Level Language}.
     
        Much hacking on small {microcomputer}s without {MMU}s consists
        of "peek"ing around memory, more or less at random, to find
        the location where the system keeps interesting stuff.  Long
        (and variably accurate) lists of such addresses for various
        computers circulate (see {interrupt list}).  The results of
        "poke"s at these addresses may be highly useful, mildly
        amusing, useless but neat, or total {lossage} (see {killer
        poke}).
     
        Since a {real operating system} provides useful, higher-level
        services for the tasks commonly performed with peeks and pokes
        on micros, and real languages tend not to encourage low-level
        memory groveling, a question like "How do I do a peek in C?"
        is diagnostic of the {newbie}.  Of course, {operating system}
        {kernel}s often have to do exactly this; a real {C} hacker
        would unhesitatingly, if unportably, assign an absolute
        address to a pointer variable and indirect through it.

      <WordDefinition>peek n.,vt. (and {poke}) The commands in most microcomputer BASICs for
   directly accessing memory contents at an absolute address; often
   extended to mean the corresponding constructs in any {HLL} (peek reads
   memory, poke modifies it). Much hacking on small, non-MMU micros used to
   consist of `peek'ing around memory, more or less at random, to find the
   location where the system keeps interesting stuff. Long (and variably
   accurate) lists of such addresses for various computers circulated (see
   {{interrupt list}}). The results of `poke's at these addresses may be
   highly useful, mildly amusing, useless but neat, or (most likely) total
   {lossage} (see {killer poke}).

   Since a {real operating system} provides useful, higher-level services
   for the tasks commonly performed with peeks and pokes on micros, and
   real languages tend not to encourage low-level memory groveling, a
   question like "How do I do a peek in C?" is diagnostic of the {newbie}.
   (Of course, OS kernels often have to do exactly this; a real kernel
   hacker would unhesitatingly, if unportably, assign an absolute address
   to a pointer variable and indirect through it.)
