      <WordDefinition>Potential \Po*ten"tial\, n.
   1. Anything that may be possible; a possibility; potentially.
      --Bacon.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Math.) In the theory of gravitation, or of other forces
      acting in space, a function of the rectangular coordinates
      which determine the position of a point, such that its
      differential coefficients with respect to the
      co["o]rdinates are equal to the components of the force at
      the point considered; -- also called {potential function},
      or {force function}. It is called also {Newtonian
      potential} when the force is directed to a fixed center
      and is inversely as the square of the distance from the
      center.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. (Elec.) The energy of an electrical charge measured by its
      power to do work; hence, the degree of electrification as
      referred to some standard, as that of the earth;
      electro-motive force.

      <WordDefinition>Potential \Po*ten"tial\, a. [Cf. F. potentiel. See {Potency}.]
   1. Being potent; endowed with energy adequate to a result;
      efficacious; influential. [Obs.] ``And hath in his effect
      a voice potential.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Existing in possibility, not in actuality. ``A potential
      hero.'' --Carlyle.
      [1913 Webster]

            Potential existence means merely that the thing may
            be at ome time; actual existence, that it now is.
                                                  --Sir W.
                                                  Hamilton.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Potential cautery}. See under {Cautery}.

   {Potential energy}. (Mech.) See the Note under {Energy}.

   {Potential mood}, or {Potential mode} (Gram.), that form of
      the verb which is used to express possibility, liberty,
      power, will, obligation, or necessity, by the use of may,
      can, must, might, could, would, or should; as, I may go;
      he can write.
