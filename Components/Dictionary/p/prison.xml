      <WordDefinition>PRISON, n.  A place of punishments and rewards.  The poet assures us
that --

    "Stone walls do not a prison make,"

but a combination of the stone wall, the political parasite and the
moral instructor is no garden of sweets.

      <WordDefinition>Prison
   The first occasion on which we read of a prison is in the
   history of Joseph in Egypt. Then Potiphar, "Joseph's master,
   took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's
   prisoners were bound" (Gen. 39:20-23). The Heb. word here used
   (sohar) means properly a round tower or fortress. It seems to
   have been a part of Potiphar's house, a place in which state
   prisoners were kept.
   
     The Mosaic law made no provision for imprisonment as a
   punishment. In the wilderness two persons were "put in ward"
   (Lev. 24:12; Num. 15:34), but it was only till the mind of God
   concerning them should be ascertained. Prisons and prisoners are
   mentioned in the book of Psalms (69:33; 79:11; 142:7). Samson
   was confined in a Philistine prison (Judg. 16:21, 25). In the
   subsequent history of Israel frequent references are made to
   prisons (1 Kings 22:27; 2 Kings 17:4; 25:27, 29; 2 Chr. 16:10;
   Isa. 42:7; Jer. 32:2). Prisons seem to have been common in New
   Testament times (Matt. 11:2; 25:36, 43). The apostles were put
   into the "common prison" at the instance of the Jewish council
   (Acts 5:18, 23; 8:3); and at Philippi Paul and Silas were thrust
   into the "inner prison" (16:24; comp. 4:3; 12:4, 5).
