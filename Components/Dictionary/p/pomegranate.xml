      <WordDefinition>Pomegranate
   i.e., "grained apple" (pomum granatum), Heb. rimmon. Common in
   Egypt (Num. 20:5) and Palestine (13:23; Deut. 8:8). The Romans
   called it Punicum malum, i.e., Carthaginian apple, because they
   received it from Carthage. It belongs to the myrtle family of
   trees. The withering of the pomegranate tree is mentioned among
   the judgments of God (Joel 1:12). It is frequently mentioned in
   the Song of Solomon (Cant. 4:3, 13, etc.). The skirt of the high
   priest's blue robe and ephod was adorned with the representation
   of pomegranates, alternating with golden bells (Ex. 28:33,34),
   as also were the "chapiters upon the two pillars" (1 Kings 7:20)
   which "stood before the house."
