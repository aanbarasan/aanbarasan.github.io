      <WordDefinition>Think \Think\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Thought}; p. pr. &amp; vb. n.
   {Thinking}.] [OE. thinken, properly, to seem, from AS.
   [thorn]yncean (cf. {Methinks}), but confounded with OE.
   thenken to think, fr. AS. [thorn]encean (imp.
   [thorn][=o]hte); akin to D. denken, dunken, OS. thenkian,
   thunkian, G. denken, d["u]nken, Icel. [thorn]ekkja to
   perceive, to know, [thorn]ykkja to seem, Goth. [thorn]agkjan,
   [thorn]aggkjan, to think, [thorn]ygkjan to think, to seem,
   OL. tongere to know. Cf. {Thank}, {Thought}.]
   1. To seem or appear; -- used chiefly in the expressions
      methinketh or methinks, and methought.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: These are genuine Anglo-Saxon expressions, equivalent
         to it seems to me, it seemed to me. In these
         expressions me is in the dative case.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. To employ any of the intellectual powers except that of
      simple perception through the senses; to exercise the
      higher intellectual faculties.

            I know, because I think.              --Dryden.

          [1913 Webster]
      (b) To reflect upon any subject; to muse; to meditate; to
          ponder; to consider; to deliberate.
          [1913 Webster]

                And when he thought thereon, he wept. --Mark
                                                  xiv. 72.
          [1913 Webster]

                He thought within himself, saying, What shall I
                do, because I have no room where to bestow my
                fruits?                           --Luke xii.

                                                  --Num. xxiv.
                                                  11.

                                                  9.
          [1913 Webster]

   Note: To think, in a philosophical use as yet somewhat
         limited, designates the higher intellectual acts, the
         acts pre["e]minently rational; to judge; to compare; to
         reason. Thinking is employed by Hamilton as
         ``comprehending all our collective energies.'' It is
         defined by Mansel as ``the act of knowing or judging by
         means of concepts,''by Lotze as ``the reaction of the
         mind on the material supplied by external influences.''
         See {Thought}.
         [1913 Webster]

   {To think better of}. See under {Better}.

   {To think much of}, or {To think well of}, to hold in esteem;
      to esteem highly.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To expect; guess; cogitate; reflect; ponder;
        contemplate; meditate; muse; imagine; suppose; believe.
        See {Expect}, {Guess}.
