   Usage: {Thrust}, {Push}, {Shove}. Push and shove usually
          imply the application of force by a body already in
          contact with the body to be impelled. Thrust, often,
          but not always, implies the impulse or application of
          force by a body which is in motion before it reaches
          the body to be impelled.
