   [1913 Webster]
   (a) The weight of twenty hundredweight.
       [1913 Webster]

   Note: In England, the ton is 2,240 pounds. In the United
         States the ton is commonly estimated at 2,000 pounds,
         this being sometimes called the short ton, while that
         of 2,240 pounds is called the long ton.
         [1913 Webster]
   (b) (Naut. &amp; Com.) Forty cubic feet of space, being the unit
       of measurement of the burden, or carrying capacity, of a
       vessel; as a vessel of 300 tons burden. See the Note

       flour; forty cubic feet of rough, or fifty cubic feet of
       hewn, timber, etc.
       [1913 Webster]

   Note: Ton and tun have the same etymology, and were formerly
         used interchangeably; but now ton generally designates
         the weight, and tun the cask. See {Tun}.
