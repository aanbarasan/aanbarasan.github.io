          [1913 Webster]

          [1913 Webster]

   Note: To think, in a philosophical use as yet somewhat
         limited, designates the higher intellectual acts, the
         acts pre["e]minently rational; to judge; to compare; to
         reason. Thinking is employed by Hamilton as
         ``comprehending all our collective energies.'' It is
         defined by Mansel as ``the act of knowing or judging by
         means of concepts,''by Lotze as ``the reaction of the
         mind on the material supplied by external influences.''
         See {Thought}.
         [1913 Webster]

   {To think better of}. See under {Better}.

   {To think much of}, or {To think well of}, to hold in esteem;
      to esteem highly.
      [1913 Webster]

                                                  --Roscommon.
