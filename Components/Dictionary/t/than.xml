      <WordDefinition>Than \Than\ ([th][a^]n), conj. [OE. than, thon, then, thanne,
   thonne, thenne, than, then, AS. [eth]anne, [eth]onne,
   [eth][ae]nne; akin to D. dan, OHG. danne, G. dann then, denn
   than, for, Goth. [thorn]an then, and to E. the, there, that.
   See {That}, and cf. {Then}.]
   A particle expressing comparison, used after certain
   adjectives and adverbs which express comparison or diversity,
   as more, better, other, otherwise, and the like. It is
   usually followed by the object compared in the nominative
   case. Sometimes, however, the object compared is placed in
   the objective case, and than is then considered by some
   grammarians as a preposition. Sometimes the object is
   expressed in a sentence, usually introduced by that; as, I
   would rather suffer than that you should want.
   [1913 Webster]
