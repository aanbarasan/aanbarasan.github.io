   Introduction Thailand
   ---------------------
                            Background: A unified Thai kingdom was
                                        established in the mid-14th century.
                                        Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand
                                        is the only Southeast Asian country
                                        never to have been taken over by a
                                        European power. A bloodless
                                        revolution in 1932 led to a
                                        constitutional monarchy. In alliance
                                        with Japan during World War II,
                                        Thailand became a US ally following
                                        the conflict.

                                        growth rate from 1985 to 1995 -
                                        averaging almost 9% annually -
                                        increased speculative pressure on
                                        Thailand's currency in 1997 led to a
                                        crisis that uncovered financial
                                        sector weaknesses and forced the
                                        government to float the baht. Long
                                        pegged at 25 to the dollar, the baht
                                        reached its lowest point of 56 to
                                        the dollar in January 1998 and the

                                        4.2% and grew 4.4% in 2000, largely
                                        due to strong exports - which
                                        increased about 20% in 2000. An
