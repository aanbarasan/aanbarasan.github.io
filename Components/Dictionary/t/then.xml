   Syn: Therefore.

   Usage: {Then}, {Therefore}. Both these words are used in
          reasoning; but therefore takes the lead, while then is
          rather subordinate or incidental. Therefore states
          reasons and draws inferences in form; then, to a great
          extent, takes the point as proved, and passes on to
          the general conclusion. ``Therefore being justified by
          faith, we have peace with God.'' --Rom. v. 1. ``So
          then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word
          of God.'' --Rom. x. 17.
