      <WordDefinition>Truth
   Used in various senses in Scripture. In Prov. 12:17, 19, it
   denotes that which is opposed to falsehood. In Isa. 59:14, 15,
   Jer. 7:28, it means fidelity or truthfulness. The doctrine of
   Christ is called "the truth of the gospel" (Gal. 2:5), "the
   truth" (2 Tim. 3:7; 4:4). Our Lord says of himself, "I am the
   way, and the truth" (John 14:6).
