   Introduction Togo
   -----------------
                            Background: French Togoland became Togo in 1960.
                                        General Gnassingbe EYADEMA,
                                        installed as military ruler in 1967,
                                        is Africa's longest-serving head of
                                        state. Despite the facade of
                                        multiparty elections instituted in
                                        the early 1990s, the government
                                        continues to be dominated by
                                        President EYADEMA, whose Rally of
                                        the Togolese People (RPT) party has
                                        maintained power almost continually
                                        since 1967. In addition, Togo has
                                        come under fire from international
                                        organizations for human rights
                                        abuses and is plagued by political
                                        unrest. Most bilateral and
                                        multilateral aid to Togo remains
                                        frozen.

   Economy Togo
   ------------
                    Economy - overview: This small sub-Saharan economy is
                                        heavily dependent on both commercial
                                        and subsistence agriculture, which
                                        provides employment for 65% of the
                                        labor force. Some basic foodstuffs
                                        must still be imported. Cocoa,
                                        coffee, and cotton generate about
                                        40% of export earnings, with cotton
                                        being the most significant cash crop
                                        despite falling prices on the world
                                        market. Political unrest, including
                                        private and public sector strikes
                                        throughout 1992 and 1993,
                                        jeopardized the reform program,
                                        shrunk the tax base, and disrupted
                                        vital economic activity. The 12
                                        January 1994 devaluation of the XOF
                                        currency by 50% provided an
                                        important impetus to renewed
                                        structural adjustment. In the
                                        industrial sector, phosphate mining
                                        is by far the most important
                                        activity. Togo is the world's fourth
                                        largest producer, and geological
                                        advantages keep production costs
                                        low. The recently privatized mining
                                        operation, Office Togolais des
                                        Phosphates (OTP), is slowly
                                        recovering from a steep fall in
                                        prices in the early 1990's, but
                                        continues to face the challenge of
                                        tough foreign competition,
                                        exacerbated by weakening demand.
                                        Togo serves as a regional commercial
                                        and trade center. It continues to
                                        expand its duty-free export-
                                        processing zone (EPZ), launched in
                                        1989, which has attracted
                                        enterprises from France, Italy,
                                        Scandinavia, the US, India, and
                                        China and created jobs for Togolese
                                        nationals. The government's decade-
                                        long effort, supported by the World
                                        Bank and the IMF, to implement
                                        economic reform measures, encourage
                                        foreign investment, and bring
                                        revenues in line with expenditures
                                        has stalled. Progress depends on
                                        following through on privatization,
                                        increased openness in government
                                        financial operations, progress
                                        towards legislative elections, and
                                        possible downsizing of the military,
                                        on which the regime has depended to
                                        stay in place. Lack of large-scale
                                        foreign aid, deterioration of the
                                        financial sector, energy shortages,
                                        and depressed commodity prices
                                        continue to constrain economic
                                        growth. The takeover of the national
                                        power company by a Franco-Canadian
                                        consortium in 2000 should ease the
                                        energy crisis.
