      <WordDefinition>TREE, n.  A tall vegetable intended by nature to serve as a penal
apparatus, though through a miscarriage of justice most trees bear
only a negligible fruit, or none at all.  When naturally fruited, the
tree is a beneficient agency of civilization and an important factor
in public morals.  In the stern West and the sensitive South its fruit
(white and black respectively) though not eaten, is agreeable to the
public taste and, though not exported, profitable to the general
welfare.  That the legitimate relation of the tree to justice was no
discovery of Judge Lynch (who, indeed, conceded it no primacy over the
lamp-post and the bridge-girder) is made plain by the following
passage from Morryster, who antedated him by two centuries:

        While in yt londe I was carried to see ye Ghogo tree, whereof
    I had hearde moch talk; but sayynge yt I saw naught remarkabyll in
    it, ye hed manne of ye villayge where it grewe made answer as
    followeth:
        "Ye tree is not nowe in fruite, but in his seasonne you shall
    see dependynge fr. his braunches all soch as have affroynted ye
    King his Majesty."
        And I was furder tolde yt ye worde "Ghogo" sygnifyeth in yr
    tong ye same as "rapscal" in our owne.
                                               _Trauvells in ye Easte_

      <WordDefinition>tree
     
        &lt;mathematics, data&gt; A {directed acyclic graph}; i.e. a {graph}
        wherein there is only one route between any pair of {nodes},
        and there is a notion of "toward top of the tree" (i.e. the
        {root node}), and its opposite direction, toward the {leaves}.
        A tree with n nodes has n-1 edges.
     
        Although maybe not part of the widest definition of a tree, a
        common constraint is that no node can have more than one
        parent.  Moreover, for some applications, it is necessary to
        consider a node's {daughter} nodes to be an ordered {list},
        instead of merely a {set}.
     
        As a data structure in computer programs, trees are used in
        everything from {B-trees} in {databases} and {file systems}, to
        {game trees} in {game theory}, to {syntax trees} in a human or
        computer {languages}.
