      <WordDefinition>Tooth \Tooth\ (t[=oo]th), n.; pl. {Teeth} (t[=e]th). [OE.
   toth,tooth, AS. t[=o][eth]; akin to OFries. t[=o]th, OS. &amp; D.
   tand, OHG. zang, zan, G. zahn, Icel. t["o]nn, Sw. &amp; Dan.
   tand, Goth. tumpus, Lith. dantis, W. dant, L. dens, dentis,
   Gr. 'odoy`s, 'odo`ntos, Skr. danta; probably originally the
   p. pr. of the verb to eat. [root]239. Cf. {Eat}, {Dandelion},
   {Dent} the tooth of a wheel, {Dental}, {Dentist}, {Indent},
   {Tine} of a fork, {Tusk}. ]
   1. (Anat.) One of the hard, bony appendages which are borne
      on the jaws, or on other bones in the walls of the mouth
      or pharynx of most vertebrates, and which usually aid in
      the prehension and mastication of food.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The hard parts of teeth are principally made up of
         dentine, or ivory, and a very hard substance called
         enamel. These are variously combined in different
         animals. Each tooth consist of three parts, a crown, or
         body, projecting above the gum, one or more fangs
         imbedded in the jaw, and the neck, or intermediate
         part. In some animals one or more of the teeth are
         modified into tusks which project from the mouth, as in
         both sexes of the elephant and of the walrus, and in
         the male narwhal.
         In adult man there are thirty-two teeth, composed
         largely of dentine, but the crowns are covered with
         enamel, and the fangs with a layer of bone called
         cementum. Of the eight teeth on each half of each jaw,
         the two in front are incisors, then come one canine,
         cuspid, or dog tooth, two bicuspids, or false molars,
         and three molars, or grinding teeth. The milk, or
         temporary, teeth are only twenty in number, there being
         two incisors, one canine, and two molars on each half
         of each jaw. The last molars, or wisdom teeth, usually
         appear long after the others, and occasionally do not
         appear above the jaw at all.
         [1913 Webster]

   3. Any projection corresponding to the tooth of an animal, in
