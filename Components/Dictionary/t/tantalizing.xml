      <WordDefinition>Tantalize \Tan"ta*lize\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Tantalized}; p.
   pr. &amp; vb. n. {Tantalizing}.] [From {Tantalus}: cf. F.
   tantaliser.]
   To tease or torment by presenting some good to the view and
   exciting desire, but continually frustrating the expectations
   by keeping that good out of reach; to tease; to torment.
   [1913 Webster]

         Thy vain desires, at strife
         Within themselves, have tantalized thy life. --Dryden.
   [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To tease; vex; irritate; provoke.

   Usage: {Tantalize}, {Disappoint}. To disappoint is literally
          to do away with what was (or was taken to be)
          appointed; hence the peculiar pain from hopes thus
          dashed to the ground. To tantalize, a much stronger
          term, describes a most distressing form of
          disappointment, as in the case of Tantalus, the
          Phrygian king. To tantalize is to visit with the
          bitterest disappointment -- to torment by exciting
          hopes or expectations which can never be realized.
          [1913 Webster]
