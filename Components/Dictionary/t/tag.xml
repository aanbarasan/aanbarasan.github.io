      <WordDefinition>tag
     
        &lt;language, text&gt; An {SGML}, {HTML}, or {XML} {token}
        representing the beginning (start tag: "&lt;p ...&gt;") or end (end
        tag: "&lt;/p&gt;") of an {element}.  In normal SGML {syntax} (and
        always in {XML}), a tag starts with a "&lt;" and ends with an
        "&gt;".
     
        In {HTML} jargon, the term "tag" is often used for an
        "{element}".
