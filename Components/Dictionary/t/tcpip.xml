        &lt;protocol&gt; {Transmission Control Protocol} over
        {Internet Protocol}.
     
        The {de facto} {standard} {Ethernet} {protocols} incorporated
        into {4.2BSD} {Unix}.  TCP/IP was developed by {DARPA} for
        {internetworking} and encompasses both {network layer} and
        {transport layer} protocols.  While {TCP} and {IP} specify two
        protocols at specific {protocol layers}, TCP/IP is often used
        to refer to the entire {DoD} {protocol} suite based upon
        these, including {telnet}, {FTP}, {UDP} and {RDP}.
     
        See also {ICMP}, {SMTP}, {SNMP}.

      <WordDefinition>TCP/IP /T'C-P I'P/ n. 1. [Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
   Protocol] The wide-area-networking protocol that makes the Internet
   work, and the only one most hackers can speak the name of without
   laughing or retching. Unlike such allegedly `standard' competitors such
   as X.25, DECnet, and the ISO 7-layer stack, TCP/IP evolved primarily by
   actually being _used_, rather than being handed down from on high by a
   vendor or a heavily-politicized standards committee. Consequently, it
   (a) works, (b) actually promotes cheap cross-platform connectivity, and
   (c) annoys the hell out of corporate and governmental empire-builders
   everywhere. Hackers value all three of these properties. See
   {creationism}. 2. [Amateur Packet Radio] Formerly expanded as "The Crap
   Phil Is Pushing". The reference is to Phil Karn, KA9Q, and the context
   was an ongoing technical/political war between the majority of sites
   still running AX.25 and the TCP/IP relays. TCP/IP won.
