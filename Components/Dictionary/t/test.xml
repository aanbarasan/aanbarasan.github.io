   Usage: {Test}, {Trial}. Trial is the wider term; test is a
          searching and decisive trial. It is derived from the
          Latin testa (earthen pot), which term was early
          applied to the fining pot, or crucible, in which
          metals are melted for trial and refinement. Hence the
          peculiar force of the word, as indicating a trial or
          criterion of the most decisive kind.
          [1913 Webster]

                I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose

                Like purest gold, that tortured in the furnace,
                Comes out more bright, and brings forth all its
                weight.                           --Addison.

      <WordDefinition>test n. 1. Real users bashing on a prototype long enough to get
   thoroughly acquainted with it, with careful monitoring and followup of
   the results. 2. Some bored random user trying a couple of the simpler
   features with a developer looking over his or her shoulder, ready to
