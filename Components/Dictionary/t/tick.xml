      <WordDefinition>tick
     
        1. A {jiffy} (sense 1).  2. In simulations, the discrete unit
        of time that passes between iterations of the simulation
        mechanism.  In AI applications, this amount of time is often
        left unspecified, since the only constraint of interest is the
        ordering of events.  This sort of AI simulation is often
        pejoratively referred to as "tick-tick-tick" simulation,
        especially when the issue of simultaneity of events with long,
        independent chains of causes is {handwave}d.  3. In the FORTH
        language, a single quote character.
