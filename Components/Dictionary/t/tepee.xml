      <WordDefinition>Wigwam \Wig"wam\, n. [From the Algonquin or Massachusetts Indian
   word w[=e]k, ``his house,'' or ``dwelling place;'' with
   possessive and locative affixes, w[=e]-kou-om-ut, ``in his
   (or their) house,'' contracted by the English to weekwam, and
   wigwam.]
   An Indian cabin or hut, usually of a conical form, and made
   of a framework of poles covered with hides, bark, or mats; --
   called also {tepee}. [Sometimes written also {weekwam}.]
   [1913 Webster]

         Very spacious was the wigwam,
         Made of deerskin dressed and whitened,
         With the gods of the Dacotahs
         Drawn and painted on its curtains.       --Longfellow.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: ``The wigwam, or Indian house, of a circular or oval
         shape, was made of bark or mats laid over a framework
         of branches of trees stuck in the ground in such a
         manner as to converge at the top, where was a central
         aperture for the escape of smoke from the fire beneath.
         The better sort had also a lining of mats. For entrance
         and egress, two low openings were left on opposite
         sides, one or the other of which was closed with bark
         or mats, according to the direction of the wind.''
         --Palfrey.
