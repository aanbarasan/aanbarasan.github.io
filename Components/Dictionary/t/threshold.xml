      <WordDefinition>Threshold
   (1.) Heb. miphtan, probably a projecting beam at a higher point
   than the threshold proper (1 Sam. 5:4,5; Ezek. 9:3; 10:4,18;
   46:2; 47:1); also rendered "door" and "door-post."
   
     (2.) 'Asuppim, pl. (Neh. 12:25), rendered correctly
   "storehouses" in the Revised Version. In 1 Chr. 26:15, 17 the
   Authorized Version retains the word as a proper name, while in
   the Revised Version it is translated "storehouses."
