      <WordDefinition>Thorax \Tho"rax\, n. [L., fr. Gr. ?.]
   1. (Anat.) The part of the trunk between the neck and the
      abdomen, containing that part of the body cavity the walls
      of which are supported by the dorsal vertebr[ae], the
      ribs, and the sternum, and which the heart and lungs are
      situated; the chest.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In mammals the thoracic cavity is completely separated
         from the abdominal by the diaphragm, but in birds and
         many reptiles the separation is incomplete, while in
         other reptiles, and in amphibians and fishes, there is
         no marked separation and no true thorax.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. (Zo["o]l.)
      (a) The middle region of the body of an insect, or that
          region which bears the legs and wings. It is composed
          of three united somites, each of which is composed of
          several distinct parts. See Illust. in Appendix. and
          Illust. of {Coleoptera}.
      (b) The second, or middle, region of the body of a
          crustacean, arachnid, or other articulate animal. In
          the case of decapod Crustacea, some writers include
          under the term thorax only the three segments bearing
          the maxillipeds; others include also the five segments
          bearing the legs. See Illust. in Appendix.
          [1913 Webster]

   3. (Antiq.) A breastplate, cuirass, or corselet; especially,
      the breastplate worn by the ancient Greeks.
      [1913 Webster]
