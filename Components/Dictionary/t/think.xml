      <WordDefinition>Think \Think\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Thought}; p. pr. &amp; vb. n.
   {Thinking}.] [OE. thinken, properly, to seem, from AS.
   [thorn]yncean (cf. {Methinks}), but confounded with OE.
   thenken to think, fr. AS. [thorn]encean (imp.
   [thorn][=o]hte); akin to D. denken, dunken, OS. thenkian,
   thunkian, G. denken, d["u]nken, Icel. [thorn]ekkja to
   perceive, to know, [thorn]ykkja to seem, Goth. [thorn]agkjan,

      methinketh or methinks, and methought.
      [1913 Webster]

         expressions me is in the dative case.

                                                  xiv. 72.
          [1913 Webster]

          [1913 Webster]

   Note: To think, in a philosophical use as yet somewhat
         limited, designates the higher intellectual acts, the
         acts pre["e]minently rational; to judge; to compare; to
         reason. Thinking is employed by Hamilton as
         ``comprehending all our collective energies.'' It is
         defined by Mansel as ``the act of knowing or judging by
         means of concepts,''by Lotze as ``the reaction of the
         mind on the material supplied by external influences.''
         See {Thought}.
         [1913 Webster]

   {To think better of}. See under {Better}.

   {To think much of}, or {To think well of}, to hold in esteem;
      to esteem highly.
      [1913 Webster]

        contemplate; meditate; muse; imagine; suppose; believe.
