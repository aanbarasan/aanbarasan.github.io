      <WordDefinition>technology
     
        &lt;jargon&gt; {Marketroid} jargon for "{software}", "{hardware}",
        "{protocol}" or something else too technical to name.
     
        The most flagrant abuse of this word has to be "{Windows NT}"
        (New Technology) - {Microsoft}'s attempt to make the
        incorporation of some ancient concepts into their OS sound
        like real progress.  The irony, and even the meaning, of this
        seems to be utterly lost on Microsoft whose {Windows 2000}
        start-up screen proclaims "Based on NT Technology", (meaning
        yet another version of NT, including some {Windows 95}
        features at last).
     
        See also: {solution}.

      <WordDefinition>Technology \Tech*nol"o*gy\, n. [Gr. ? an art + -logy; cf. Gr. ?
   systematic treatment: cf. F. technologie.]
   Industrial science; the science of systematic knowledge of
   the industrial arts, especially of the more important
   manufactures, as spinning, weaving, metallurgy, etc.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Technology is not an independent science, having a set
         of doctrines of its own, but consists of applications
         of the principles established in the various physical
         sciences (chemistry, mechanics, mineralogy, etc.) to
         manufacturing processes. --Internat. Cyc.
         [1913 Webster]
