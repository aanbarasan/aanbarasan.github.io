      <WordDefinition>Testament
   occurs twelve times in the New Testament (Heb. 9:15, etc.) as
   the rendering of the Gr. diatheke, which is twenty times
   rendered "covenant" in the Authorized Version, and always so in
   the Revised Version. The Vulgate translates incorrectly by
   testamentum, whence the names "Old" and "New Testament," by
   which we now designate the two sections into which the Bible is
   divided. (See {BIBLE}.)

      <WordDefinition>Testament \Tes"ta*ment\, n. [F., fr. L. testamentum, fr. testari
   to be a witness, to make one's last will, akin to testis a
   witness. Cf. {Intestate}, {Testify}.]
   1. (Law) A solemn, authentic instrument in writing, by which
      a person declares his will as to disposal of his estate
      and effects after his death.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: This is otherwise called a will, and sometimes a last
         will and testament. A testament, to be valid, must be
         made by a person of sound mind; and it must be executed
         and published in due form of law. A man, in certain
         cases, may make a valid will by word of mouth only. See
         {Nuncupative will}, under {Nuncupative}.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. One of the two distinct revelations of God's purposes
      toward man; a covenant; also, one of the two general
      divisions of the canonical books of the sacred Scriptures,
      in which the covenants are respectively revealed; as, the
      Old Testament; the New Testament; -- often limited, in
      colloquial language, to the latter.
      [1913 Webster]

            He is the mediator of the new testament . . . for
            the redemption of the transgressions that were under
            the first testament.                  --Heb. ix. 15.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Holographic testament}, a testament written wholly by the
      testator himself. --Bouvier.
      [1913 Webster]
