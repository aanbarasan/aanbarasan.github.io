      <WordDefinition>Turkey \Tur"key\, n.; pl. {Turkeys}. [So called because it was
   formerly erroneously believed that it came originally from
   Turkey: cf. F. Turquie Turkey. See {Turk}.] (Zo["o]l.)
   Any large American gallinaceous bird belonging to the genus
   {Meleagris}, especially the North American wild turkey

   domesticated by the Indians long before the discovery of
   America.

         the northern species (var. Mexicana). Its tall feathers
         and coverts are tipped with white instead of brownish
         chestnut, and its flesh is white. The Central American,
         or ocellated, turkey ({Meleagris ocellata}) is more
         elegantly colored than the common species. See under

      ({Cathartes aura}), abundant in the Southern United

   Introduction Turkey
   -------------------
                            Background: Turkey was created in 1923 from the
                                        Turkish remnants of the Ottoman
                                        Empire. Soon thereafter the country
                                        instituted secular laws to replace
                                        traditional religious fiats. In 1945
                                        Turkey joined the UN and in 1952 it
                                        became a member of NATO. Turkey
                                        occupied the northern portion of
                                        Cyprus in 1974 to prevent a Greek
                                        takeover of the island; relations
                                        between the two countries remain
                                        strained but have begun to improve
                                        over the past three years. In 1984,
                                        the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK),
                                        a Marxist-Leninist, separatist
                                        group, initiated an insurgency in
                                        Southeast Turkey, often using
                                        terrorist tactics to try to attain
                                        its goal of an independent
                                        Kurdistan. The group - whose leader,
                                        Abdullah OCALAN, was captured in
                                        Kenya in February 1999 and sentenced
                                        to death by a Turkish court - has
                                        observed a unilateral cease-fire
                                        since September 1999, although there
                                        have been occasional clashes between
                                        Turkish military units and some of
                                        the 4,000-5,000 armed PKK militants,
                                        most of whom currently are encamped
                                        in northern Iraq. The PKK changed
                                        its name to the Kurdistan Freedom
                                        and Democracy Congress (KADEK) in
                                        April 2002.

                                        agriculture sector that in 2001
                                        still accounted for 40% of
                                        employment. It has a strong and
                                        rapidly growing private sector, yet
                                        the state still plays a major role
                                        in basic industry, banking,
                                        transport, and communication. The
                                        most important industry - and
                                        largest exporter - is textiles and
                                        clothing, which is almost entirely
                                        in private hands. In recent years
                                        the economic situation has been
                                        marked by erratic economic growth
                                        and serious imbalances. Real GNP
                                        growth has exceeded 6% in most
                                        years, but this strong expansion was
                                        interrupted by sharp declines in
                                        output in 1994, 1999, and 2001.
                                        Meanwhile the public sector fiscal
                                        deficit has regularly exceeded 10%
                                        of GDP - due in large part to the
                                        huge burden of interest payments,
                                        which in 2001 accounted for more
                                        than 50% of central government
                                        spending - while inflation has
                                        remained in the high double digit
                                        range. Perhaps because of these
                                        problems, foreign direct investment
                                        in Turkey remains low - less than $1
                                        billion annually. In late 2000 and
                                        early 2001 a growing trade deficit
                                        and serious weaknesses in the
                                        banking sector plunged the economy
                                        into crisis - forcing Ankara to
                                        float the lira and pushing the
                                        country into recession. Prospects
                                        for 2002 are much better, because of
                                        strong financial support from the
                                        IMF, tighter fiscal policy, a major
                                        bank restructuring program, and the
                                        enactment of numerous other economic
                                        reforms.
