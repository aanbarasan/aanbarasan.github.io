      <WordDefinition>Constable \Con"sta*ble\ (k[o^]n"st[.a]*b'l or
   k[u^]n"st[.a]*b'l), n. [OE. conestable, constable, a
   constable (in sense 1), OF. conestable, F. conn['e]table, LL.
   conestabulus, constabularius, comes stabuli, orig., count of
   the stable, master of the horse, equerry; comes count (L.
   companion) + L. stabulum stable. See {Count} a nobleman, and
   {Stable}.]
   1. A high officer in the monarchical establishments of the
      Middle Ages.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The constable of France was the first officer of the
         crown, and had the chief command of the army. It was
         also his duty to regulate all matters of chivalry. The
         office was suppressed in 1627. The constable, or lord
         high constable, of England, was one of the highest
         officers of the crown, commander in chief of the
         forces, and keeper of the peace of the nation. He also
         had judicial cognizance of many important matters. The
         office was as early as the Conquest, but has been
         disused (except on great and solemn occasions), since
         the attainder of Stafford, duke of Buckingham, in the
         reign of Henry VIII.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. (Law) An officer of the peace having power as a
      conservator of the public peace, and bound to execute the
      warrants of judicial officers. --Bouvier.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In England, at the present time, the constable is a
         conservator of the peace within his district, and is
         also charged by various statutes with other duties,
         such as serving summons, precepts, warrants, etc. In
         the United States, constables are town or city officers
         of the peace, with powers similar to those of the
         constables of England. In addition to their duties as
         conservators of the peace, they are invested with
         others by statute, such as to execute civil as well as
         criminal process in certain cases, to attend courts,
         keep juries, etc. In some cities, there are officers
         called {high constables}, who act as chiefs of the
         constabulary or police force. In other cities the title
         of constable, as well as the office, is merged in that
         of the police officer.
         [1913 Webster]

   {High constable}, a constable having certain duties and
      powers within a hundred. [Eng.]

   {Petty constable}, a conservator of the peace within a parish
      or tithing; a tithingman. [Eng.]

      of special occasions.

      --Smollett.

      <WordDefinition>To- \To-\ (?, see {To}, prep.), [AS. to- asunder; akin to G.
   zer-, and perhaps to L. dis-, or Gr. ?.]
   An obsolete intensive prefix used in the formation of
   compound verbs; as in to-beat, to-break, to-hew, to-rend,
   to-tear. See these words in the Vocabulary. See the Note on
   {All to}, or {All-to}, under {All}, adv.

      <WordDefinition>To \To\ (?, emphatic or alone, ?, obscure or unemphatic), prep.
   [AS. t[=o]; akin to OS. &amp; OFries. t[=o], D. toe, G. zu, OHG.
   zuo, zua, z[=o], Russ. do, Ir. &amp; Gael. do, OL. -do, -du, as
   in endo, indu, in, Gr. ?, as in ? homeward. [root]200. Cf.
   {Too}, {Tatoo} a beat of drums.]
   1. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and
      arrival, motion made in the direction of a place or thing
      and attaining it, access; and also, motion or tendency
      without arrival; movement toward; -- opposed to {from}.
      ``To Canterbury they wend.'' --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

            Stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.   --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            So to the sylvan lodge
            They came, that like Pomona's arbor smiled.
                                                  --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

            I'll to him again, . . .
            He'll tell me all his purpose.
            She stretched her arms to heaven.     --Dryden.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Hence, it indicates motion, course, or tendency toward a
      time, a state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of
      being regarded as a limit to a tendency, movement, or
      action; as, he is going to a trade; he is rising to wealth
      and honor.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Formerly, by omission of the verb denoting motion, to
         sometimes followed a form of be, with the sense of at,
         or in. ``When the sun was [gone or declined] to rest.''
         --Chaucer.
         [1913 Webster]

   3. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of
      application, to connects transitive verbs with their
      remoter or indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and
      neuter or passive verbs with a following noun which limits
      their action. Its sphere verges upon that of for, but it
      contains less the idea of design or appropriation; as,
      these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let us
      keep this seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the
      taste; an event painful to the mind; duty to God and to
      our parents; a dislike to spirituous liquor.
      [1913 Webster]

            Marks and points out each man of us to slaughter.
                                                  --B. Jonson.
      [1913 Webster]

            Whilst they, distilled
            Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
            Stand dumb and speak not to him.      --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
            and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance
            patience; and to patience godliness; and to
            godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly
            kindness charity.                     --2 Pet. i.
                                                  5,6,7.
      [1913 Webster]

            I have a king's oath to the contrary. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            Numbers were crowded to death.        --Clarendon.
      [1913 Webster]

            Fate and the dooming gods are deaf to tears.
                                                  --Dryden.
      [1913 Webster]

            Go, buckle to the law.                --Dryden.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of
      last defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun,
      and connecting it as indirect object with a preceding verb
      or adjective; thus, ready to go, i.e., ready unto going;
      good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do my utmost to lead
      my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the almost
      constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations
      where it has no prepositional meaning, as where the
      infinitive is direct object or subject; thus, I love to
      learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one's country is
      noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. Where the
      infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage
      formerly allowed the prefixing of for to the to; as, what
      went ye out for see? (--Matt. xi. 8).
      [1913 Webster]

            Then longen folk to go on pilgrimages,
            And palmers for to seeken strange stranders.
                                                  --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Such usage is now obsolete or illiterate. In colloquial
         usage, to often stands for, and supplies, an infinitive
         already mentioned; thus, he commands me to go with him,
         but I do not wish to.
         [1913 Webster]

   5. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words,
      to has a pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically. Thus,
      it denotes or implies:
      (a) Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as
          far as; as, they met us to the number of three
          hundred.
          [1913 Webster]

                We ready are to try our fortunes
                To the last man.                  --Shak.
          [1913 Webster]

                Few of the Esquimaux can count to ten. --Quant.
                                                  Rev.
          [1913 Webster]
      (b) Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered
          to his ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent
          factions exist to the prejudice of the state.
      (c) Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as,
          they engaged hand to hand.
          [1913 Webster]

                Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then
                face to face.                     --1 Cor. xiii.
                                                  12.
          [1913 Webster]
      (d) Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste;
          she has a husband to her mind.
          [1913 Webster]

                He to God's image, she to his was made.
                                                  --Dryden.
          [1913 Webster]
      (e) Comparison; as, three is to nine as nine is to
          twenty-seven; it is ten to one that you will offend
          him.
          [1913 Webster]

                All that they did was piety to this. --B.
                                                  Jonson.
          [1913 Webster]
      (f) Addition; union; accumulation.
          [1913 Webster]

                Wisdom he has, and to his wisdom, courage.

          [1913 Webster]
      (g) Accompaniment; as, she sang to his guitar; they danced
          to the music of a piano.
          [1913 Webster]

                Anon they move

          [1913 Webster]

          office filled. [In this sense archaic] ``I have a king
          here to my flatterer.'' --Shak.

                Made his masters and others . . . to consider
                him to a little wonder.           --Walton.
          [1913 Webster]

   Note: To in to-day, to-night, and to-morrow has the sense or
         force of for or on; for, or on, (this) day, for, or on,
         (this) night, for, or on, (the) morrow. To-day,
         to-night, to-morrow may be considered as compounds, and
         usually as adverbs; but they are sometimes used as
         nouns; as, to-day is ours.
         [1913 Webster]

               To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow;
               Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.

         [1913 Webster]

   {To and again}, to and fro. [R.]

   {To-and-fro}, a pacing backward and forward; as, to commence

   Note: To, without an object expressed, is used adverbially;
         as, put to the door, i. e., put the door to its frame,
         close it; and in the nautical expressions, to heave to,
         to come to, meaning to a certain position. To, like on,
         is sometimes used as a command, forward, set to. ``To,
         Achilles! to, Ajax! to!'' --Shak.
