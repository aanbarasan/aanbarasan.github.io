      <WordDefinition>Tickle
     
        &lt;text, tool&gt; A {text editor}, file translator and {TCL}
        {interpreter} for the {Macintosh}.
     
        Version 5.0v1.  The text editor breaks the 32K limit (like
        {MPW}).
     
        The file translation utilities support {drag and drop}
        handling via tcl scripts of {BinHex}, {MacBinary}, {Apple
        Computer} Single/Double, {StuffIt} (with engine), {Unix}
        {compress}, {Unix} {tar} and {UUencode} files as well as text
        translation.
     
        Tickle implements tcl 7.0 with {tclX} extensions and
        {Macintosh} equivalents of {Unix}'s {ls}, {pwd}, {cd}
        commands.  It provides Macintosh access to {Resource Manager},
        {Communications Toolbox}, {OSA} Components (and
        {AppleScript}), {Editions} (publish and subscribe) and {Apple
        Events} (including AEBuild and AEPrint).  {OSA Script} support
        allows programming of any OSA scripting component within
        Tickle interpreter windows.  It provides the OSAtcl and OSAJ
        {J}/{APL} extensions and creates "Ticklets" which are small
        {application program}s that carry only the tcl script and use
        code in the OSAtcl component to drive an application that
        allows {drag and drop} with tcl scripts.  Tickle is scriptable
        and recordable.
