      normally in small amount, by the lachrymal gland, and
      diffused between the eye and the eyelids to moisten the
      parts and facilitate their motion. Ordinarily the
      secretion passes through the lachrymal duct into the nose,
      but when it is increased by emotion or other causes, it
      overflows the lids.
      [1913 Webster]

            Her fragrant flowers, her trees with precious tears.

      9th.

   {Tears of wine}, drops which form and roll down a glass above
      the surface of strong wine. The phenomenon is due to the

      creeps up the sides until its weight causes it to break.
