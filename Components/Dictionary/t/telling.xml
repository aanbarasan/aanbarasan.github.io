   Note: Tell, though equivalent in some respect to speak and
         say, has not always the same application. We say, to
         tell truth or falsehood, to tell a number, to tell the
         reasons, to tell something or nothing; but we never
         say, to tell a speech, discourse, or oration, or to
         tell an argument or a lesson. It is much used in
         commands; as, tell me the whole story; tell me all you
         know.

   {To tell off}, to count; to divide. --Sir W. Scott.
