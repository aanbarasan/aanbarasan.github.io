      <WordDefinition>trivial adj. 1. Too simple to bother detailing. 2. Not worth the
   speaker's time. 3. Complex, but solvable by methods so well known that
   anyone not utterly {cretinous} would have thought of them already. 4.
   Any problem one has already solved (some claim that hackish `trivial'
   usually evaluates to `I've seen it before'). Hackers' notions of
   triviality may be quite at variance with those of non-hackers. See
   {nontrivial}, {uninteresting}.

   The physicist Richard Feynman, who had the hacker nature to an amazing
   degree (see his essay "Los Alamos From Below" in "Surely You're Joking,
   Mr. Feynman!"), defined `trivial theorem' as "one that has already been
   proved".
