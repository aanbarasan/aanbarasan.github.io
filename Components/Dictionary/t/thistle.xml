      <WordDefinition>Thistle
   (1.) Heb. hoah (2 Kings 14:9; Job 31:40). In Job 41:2 the Hebrew
   word is rendered "thorn," but in the Revised Version "hook." It
   is also rendered "thorn" in 2 Chr. 33:11; Prov. 26:9; Cant. 2:2;
   "brambles" in Isa. 34:13. It is supposed to be a variety of the
   wild plum-tree, but by some it is regarded as the common
   thistle, of which there are many varieties in Palestine.
   
     (2.) Heb. dardar, meaning "a plant growing luxuriantly" (Gen.
   3:18; Hos. 10:8); Gr. tribolos, "a triple point" (Matt. 7:16;
   Heb. 6:8, "brier," R.V. "thistle"). This was probably the
   star-thistle, called by botanists Centaurea calcitropa, or
   "caltrops," a weed common in corn-fields. (See {THORNS}.)
