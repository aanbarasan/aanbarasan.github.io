      <WordDefinition>Toad \Toad\, n. [OE. tode, tade, AS. t[=a]die, t[=a]dige; of
   unknown origin. Cf. {Tadpole}.] (Zo["o]l.)
   Any one of numerous species of batrachians belonging to the
   genus {Bufo} and allied genera, especially those of the
   family {Bufonid[ae]}. Toads are generally terrestrial in
   their habits except during the breeding season, when they
   seek the water. Most of the species burrow beneath the earth
   in the daytime and come forth to feed on insects at night.
   Most toads have a rough, warty skin in which are glands that
   secrete an acrid fluid.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The common toad ({Bufo vulgaris}) and the natterjack
         are familiar European species. The common American toad
         ({Bufo lentiginosus}) is similar to the European toad,
         but is less warty and is more active, moving chiefly by
         leaping.
         [1913 Webster]
