      <WordDefinition>Theft
   Punished by restitution, the proportions of which are noted in 2
   Sam. 12:6. If the thief could not pay the fine, he was to be
   sold to a Hebrew master till he could pay (Ex. 22:1-4). A
   night-thief might be smitten till he died, and there would be no
   blood-guiltiness for him (22:2). A man-stealer was to be put to
   death (21:16). All theft is forbidden (Ex. 20:15; 21:16; Lev.
   19:11; Deut. 5:19; 24:7; Ps. 50:18; Zech. 5:3; Matt. 19:18; Rom.
   13:9; Eph. 4:28; 1 Pet. 4:15).
