      <WordDefinition>Trilogy
     
        &lt;language&gt; A {strongly typed} {logic programming} language
        with numerical {constraint}-solving over the {natural
        numbers}, developed by Paul Voda &lt;voda@voda.ii.fmph.uniba.sk&gt;
        at {UBC} in 1988.  Trilogy is syntactically a blend of
        {Prolog}, {Lisp}, and {Pascal}.  It contains three types of
        {clauses}: {predicates} ({backtracking} but no assignable
        variables), procedures (if-then-else but no backtracking;
        assignable variables), and {subroutines} (like procedures, but
        with input and {system calls}; callable only from top level or
        from other subroutines).
     
        Development of Trilogy I stopped in 1991.  Trilogy II,
        developed by Paul Voda 1988-92, was a {declarative} general
        purpose programming language, used for teaching and to write
        {CL}.

      <WordDefinition>Trilogy \Tril"o*gy\, n. [Gr. trilogi`a; pref. tri- (see {Tri-})
   + lo`gos speech, discourse: cf. F. trilogie.]
   A series of three dramas which, although each of them is in
   one sense complete, have a close mutual relation, and form
   one historical and poetical picture. Shakespeare's `` Henry
   VI.'' is an example.
   [1913 Webster]

         On the Greek stage, a drama, or acted story, consisted
         in reality of three dramas, called together a trilogy,
         and performed consecutively in the course of one day.
                                                  --Coleridge.
   [1913 Webster]
