   {green turtle} (Zo["o]l.), a marine turtle of the genus
      {Chelonia}, having usually a smooth greenish or
      olive-colored shell. It is highly valued for the delicacy
      of its flesh, which is used especially for turtle soup.
      Two distinct species or varieties are known; one of which
      ({Chelonia Midas}) inhabits the warm part of the Atlantic
      Ocean, and sometimes weighs eight hundred pounds or more;
      the other ({Chelonia virgata}) inhabits the Pacific Ocean.
      Both species are similar in habits and feed principally on
      seaweed and other marine plants, especially the turtle
      grass.

   {Turtle cowrie} (Zo["o]l.), a large, handsome cowrie
      ({Cypr[ae]a testudinaria}); the turtle-shell; so called
      because of its fancied resemblance to a tortoise in color
      and form.

   {Turtle grass} (Bot.), a marine plant ({Thalassia
      testudinum}) with grasslike leaves, common about the West
      Indies.

   {Turtle shell}, tortoise shell. See under {Tortoise}.
