      <WordDefinition>Tautology \Tau*tol"o*gy\, n. [L. tautologia, Gr. ?: cf. F.
   tautologie.] (Rhet.)
   A repetition of the same meaning in different words; needless
   repetition of an idea in different words or phrases; a
   representation of anything as the cause, condition, or
   consequence of itself, as in the following lines: 

         The dawn is overcast, the morning lowers,
         And heavily in clouds brings on the day. --Addison.
   [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Repetition.

   Usage: {Tautology}, {Repetition}. There may be frequent
          repetitions (as in legal instruments) which are
          warranted either by necessity or convenience; but
          tautology is always a fault, being a sameness of
          expression which adds nothing to the sense or the
          sound.
          [1913 Webster]
