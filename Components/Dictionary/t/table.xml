      <WordDefinition>TABLE D':HOTE:, n.  A caterer's thrifty concession to the universal
passion for irresponsibility.

    Old Paunchinello, freshly wed,
        Took Madam P. to table,
    And there deliriously fed
        As fast as he was able.

    "I dote upon good grub," he cried,
        Intent upon its throatage.
    "Ah, yes," said the neglected bride,
        "You're in your _table d'hotage_."
                                                      Associated Poets
