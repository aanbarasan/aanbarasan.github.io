      <WordDefinition>Tea \Tea\ (t[=e]), n. [Chin. tsh[=a], Prov. Chin. te: cf. F.
   th['e].]
   1. The prepared leaves of a shrub, or small tree ({Thea
      Chinensis} or {Camellia Chinensis}). The shrub is a native
      of China, but has been introduced to some extent into some
      other countries.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Teas are classed as green or black, according to their
         color or appearance, the kinds being distinguished also
         by various other characteristic differences, as of
         taste, odor, and the like. The color, flavor, and
         quality are dependent upon the treatment which the
         leaves receive after being gathered. The leaves for
         green tea are heated, or roasted slightly, in shallow
         pans over a wood fire, almost immediately after being
         gathered, after which they are rolled with the hands
         upon a table, to free them from a portion of their
         moisture, and to twist them, and are then quickly
         dried. Those intended for black tea are spread out in
         the air for some time after being gathered, and then
         tossed about with the hands until they become soft and
         flaccid, when they are roasted for a few minutes, and
         rolled, and having then been exposed to the air for a
         few hours in a soft and moist state, are finally dried
         slowly over a charcoal fire. The operation of roasting
         and rolling is sometimes repeated several times, until
         the leaves have become of the proper color. The
         principal sorts of green tea are Twankay, the poorest
         kind; Hyson skin, the refuse of Hyson; Hyson, Imperial,
         and Gunpowder, fine varieties; and Young Hyson, a
         choice kind made from young leaves gathered early in
         the spring. Those of black tea are Bohea, the poorest
         kind; Congou; Oolong; Souchong, one of the finest
         varieties; and Pekoe, a fine-flavored kind, made
         chiefly from young spring buds. See {Bohea}, {Congou},
         {Gunpowder tea}, under {Gunpowder}, {Hyson}, {Oolong},
         and {Souchong}. --K. Johnson. --Tomlinson.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: ``No knowledge of . . . [tea] appears to have reached
         Europe till after the establishment of intercourse
         between Portugal and China in 1517. The Portuguese,
         however, did little towards the introduction of the
         herb into Europe, and it was not till the Dutch
         established themselves at Bantam early in 17th century,
         that these adventurers learned from the Chinese the
         habit of tea drinking, and brought it to Europe.''
         --Encyc. Brit.
         [1913 Webster]
