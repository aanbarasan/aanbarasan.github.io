      <WordDefinition>Temple
   first used of the tabernacle, which is called "the temple of the
   Lord" (1 Sam. 1:9). In the New Testament the word is used
   figuratively of Christ's human body (John 2:19, 21). Believers
   are called "the temple of God" (1 Cor. 3:16, 17). The Church is
   designated "an holy temple in the Lord" (Eph. 2:21). Heaven is
   also called a temple (Rev. 7:5). We read also of the heathen
   "temple of the great goddess Diana" (Acts 19:27).
   
     This word is generally used in Scripture of the sacred house
   erected on the summit of Mount Moriah for the worship of God. It
   is called "the temple" (1 Kings 6:17); "the temple [R.V.,
   'house'] of the Lord" (2 Kings 11:10); "thy holy temple" (Ps.
   79:1); "the house of the Lord" (2 Chr. 23:5, 12); "the house of
   the God of Jacob" (Isa. 2:3); "the house of my glory" (60:7); an
   "house of prayer" (56:7; Matt. 21:13); "an house of sacrifice"
   (2 Chr. 7:12); "the house of their sanctuary" (2 Chr. 36:17);
   "the mountain of the Lord's house" (Isa. 2:2); "our holy and our
   beautiful house" (64:11); "the holy mount" (27:13); "the palace
   for the Lord God" (1 Chr. 29:1); "the tabernacle of witness" (2
   Chr. 24:6); "Zion" (Ps. 74:2; 84:7). Christ calls it "my
   Father's house" (John 2:16).
