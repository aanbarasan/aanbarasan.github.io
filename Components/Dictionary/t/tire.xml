      <WordDefinition>Tire \Tire\, n. [Aphetic form of attire; OE. tir, a tir. See
   {Attire}.]
   1. Attire; apparel. [Archaic] ``Having rich tire about you.''
      --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. A covering for the head; a headdress.
      [1913 Webster]

      [1913 Webster]

   4. Furniture; apparatus; equipment. [Obs.] ``The tire of

      [1913 Webster]

   5. [Probably the same word, and so called as being an attire
      or covering for the wheel.] A ring, hoop or band, as of
      rubber or metal, on the circumference of the wheel of a
      vehicle, to impart strength and receive the wear. In
      Britain, spelled {tyre}.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The iron tire of a wagon wheel or cart wheel binds the
         fellies together. The tire of a locomotive or
         railroad-car wheel is a heavy hoop of iron or steel
         shrunk tightly upon an iron central part. The wheel of
         a bicycle or road vehicle (automobile, motorcyle,
         truck) has a tire of rubber, which is typically hollow
         inside and inflated with air to lessen the shocks from
         bumps on uneven roads.
