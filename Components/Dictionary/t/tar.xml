      <WordDefinition>tar
     
        &lt;file format&gt; ("Tape ARchive", following {ar}) {Unix}'s
        general purpose {archive} utility and the file format it uses.
        Tar was originally intended for use with {magnetic tape} but,
        though it has several {command line options} related to tape,
        it is now used more often for packaging files together on
        other media, e.g. for distribution via the {Internet}.
     
        The resulting archive, a "tar file" (humourously, "tarball")
        is often compressed, using {gzip} or some other form of
        compression (see {tar and feather}).
     
        There is a {GNU} version of tar called {gnutar} with several
        improvements over the standard versions.
     
        {Filename extension}: .tar
     
        {MIME type}: unregistered, but commonly application/x-tar
     
        {Unix manual page}: tar(1).
     
        Compare {shar}, {zip}.
