      <WordDefinition>Talented \Tal"ent*ed\, a.
   Furnished with talents; possessing skill or talent; mentally
   gifted. --Abp. Abbot (1663).
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: This word has been strongly objected to by Coleridge
         and some other critics, but, as it would seem, upon not
         very good grounds, as the use of talent or talents to
         signify mental ability, although at first merely
         metaphorical, is now fully established, and talented,
         as a formative, is just as analogical and legitimate as
         gifted, bigoted, moneyed, landed, lilied, honeyed, and
         numerous other adjectives having a participal form, but
         derived directly from nouns and not from verbs.
