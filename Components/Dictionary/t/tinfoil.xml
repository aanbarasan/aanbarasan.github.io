      <WordDefinition>Tin \Tin\, n. [As. tin; akin to D. tin, G. zinn, OHG. zin, Icel.
   &amp; Dan. tin, Sw. tenn; of unknown origin.]
   1. (Chem.) An elementary substance found as an oxide in the
      mineral cassiterite, and reduced as a soft silvery-white
      crystalline metal, with a tinge of yellowish-blue, and a
      high luster. It is malleable at ordinary temperatures, but
      brittle when heated. It is softer than gold and can be
      beaten out into very thin strips called tinfoil. It is
      ductile at 2120, when it can be drawn out into wire which
      is not very tenacious; it melts at 4420, and at a higher
      temperature burns with a brilliant white light. Air and
      moisture act on tin very slightly. The peculiar properties
      of tin, especially its malleability, its brilliancy and
      the slowness with which it rusts make it very serviceable.
      With other metals it forms valuable alloys, as bronze, gun
      metal, bell metal, pewter and solder. It is not easily
      oxidized in the air, and is used chiefly to coat iron to
      protect it from rusting, in the form of tin foil with
      mercury to form the reflective surface of mirrors, and in
      solder, bronze, speculum metal, and other alloys. Its
      compounds are designated as stannous, or stannic. Symbol
      Sn (Stannum). Atomic weight 117.4.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Thin plates of iron covered with tin; tin plate.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Money. [Cant] --Beaconsfield.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Block tin} (Metal.), commercial tin, cast into blocks, and

      called when used as a mordant.

   {Tin frame} (Mining), a kind of buddle used in washing tin
      ore.

   {Tin liquor}, {Tin mordant} (Dyeing), stannous chloride, used
