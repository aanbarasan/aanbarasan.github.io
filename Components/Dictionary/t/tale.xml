      <WordDefinition>Tale
   (1.) Heb. tokhen, "a task," as weighed and measured out = tally,
   i.e., the number told off; the full number (Ex. 5:18; see 1 Sam.
   18:27; 1 Chr. 9:28). In Ezek. 45:11 rendered "measure."
   
     (2.) Heb. hegeh, "a thought;" "meditation" (Ps. 90:9); meaning
   properly "as a whisper of sadness," which is soon over, or "as a
   thought." The LXX. and Vulgate render it "spider;" the
   Authorized Version and Revised Version, "as a tale" that is
   told. In Job 37:2 this word is rendered "sound;" Revised Version
   margin, "muttering;" and in Ezek. 2:10, "mourning."
