      <WordDefinition>toy
     
        A computer system; always used with qualifiers.
     
        1. "nice toy": One that supports the speaker's hacking style
        adequately.
     
        2. "just a toy": A machine that yields insufficient
        {computron}s for the speaker's preferred uses.  This is not
        condemnatory, as is {bitty box}; toys can at least be fun.  It
        is also strongly conditioned by one's expectations; Cray XMP
        users sometimes consider the Cray-1 a "toy", and certainly all
        RISC boxes and mainframes are toys by their standards.  See
        also {Get a real computer!}.
