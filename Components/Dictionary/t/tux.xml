      <WordDefinition>Tux Tux the Penguin is the official emblem of {Linux}, This eventuated
   after a logo contest in 1996, during which Linus Torvalds endorsed the
   idea of a penguin logo in a couple of famously funny postings
   (http://www.woodsoup.org/~sbaker/tux/doc/). Linus explained that he was
   once bitten by a killer penguin in Australia and has felt a special
   affinity for the species ever since. (Linus has since admitted that he
   was also thinking of Feathers McGraw, the evil-genius penguin jewel
   thief who appeared in a Wallace &amp; Grommit feature cartoon, "The Wrong
   Trousers".)

   Larry Ewing designed (http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/) the
   official Tux logo. It has proved a wise choice, amenable to hundreds of
   recognizable variations used as emblems of Linux-related projects,
   products, and user groups. In fact, Tux has spawned an entire mythology,
   of which the Gospel According to Tux
   (http://www.ao.com/~regan/penguins/tux.html) and the mock-epic poem
   "Tuxowolf" are among the best-known examples.

   There is a `real' Tux - a black-footed penguin resident at the Bristol
   Zoo. Several friends of Linux bought a zoo sponsorship for Linus as a
   birthday present in 1996.
