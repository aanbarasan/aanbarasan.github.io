        &lt;jargon&gt; 1. The archetypal really stupid {application} for an
        {embedded} {microprocessor} controller; often used in comments
        that imply that a scheme is inappropriate technology (but see
        {elevator controller}).  "{DWIM} for an assembler?  That'd be
        as silly as running {Unix} on your toaster!"
     
        2. A very, very dumb computer. "You could run this program on
        any dumb toaster."
     
        See {bitty box}, {Get a real computer!}, {toy}, {beige
        toaster}.
     
        3. A {Macintosh}, especially the {Classic Mac}.  Some hold
        that this is implied by sense 2.
     
        4. A peripheral device.  "I bought my box without toasters,
        but since then I've added two boards and a second disk drive".
     
        This is not usually to be taken literally but, to show off the
        expansion capabilities of the {Risc PC}, {Acorn Computers
        Ltd.} built a seven-slice machine (which they called "the
        rocket-ship") and installed every imaginable peripheral.  In a
        spare {drive bay} of the top slice they installed a toaster.
        This machine was exhibited at various shows where it attracted
        attention by occasionally ejecting a pizza.
