      [Obs. or Slang] --B. Jonson.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: High; lofty.

   Usage: {Tall}, {High}, {Lofty}. High is the generic term, and
          is applied to anything which is elevated or raised
          above another thing. Tall specifically describes that
          which has a small diameter in proportion to its
          height; hence, we speak of a tall man, a tall steeple,
          a tall mast, etc., but not of a tall hill. Lofty has a
          special reference to the expanse above us, and denotes
          an imposing height; as, a lofty mountain; a lofty
          room. Tall is now properly applied only to physical
          objects; high and lofty have a moral acceptation; as,
          high thought, purpose, etc.; lofty aspirations; a
          lofty genius. Lofty is the stronger word, and is
          usually coupled with the grand or admirable.
          [1913 Webster]
