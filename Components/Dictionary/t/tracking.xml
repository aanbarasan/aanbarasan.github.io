      <WordDefinition>tracking
     
        &lt;text&gt; The spacing between {characters} in a line of {text}.
        This is defined when a {font} is designed but can often be
        altered in order to change the appearance of the text or for
        special effects.
     
        Tracking should not be confused with {kerning} which deals
        with the spacing between certain pairs of characters.
     
        See also {leading}.
