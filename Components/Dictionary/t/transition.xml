      [1913 Webster]

   Note: This word is sometimes pronounced tran*sish"un; but
         according to Walker, Smart, and most other authorities,
         the customary and preferable pronunciation is
         tran*sizh"un, although this latter mode violates
         analogy. Other authorities say tran*zish"un.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Transition rocks} (Geol.), a term formerly applied to the
      lowest uncrystalline stratified rocks (graywacke) supposed
      to contain no fossils, and so called because thought to
      have been formed when the earth was passing from an
      uninhabitable to a habitable state.
      [1913 Webster]
