      <WordDefinition>Threaten \Threat"en\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Threatened}; p. pr. &amp;
   vb. n. {Threatening}.] [OE. [thorn]retenen. See {Threat}, v.
   t.]
   1. To utter threats against; to menace; to inspire with
      apprehension; to alarm, or attempt to alarm, as with the
      promise of something evil or disagreeable; to warn.
      [1913 Webster]

            Let us straitly threaten them, that they speak
            henceforth to no man in this name.    --Acts iv. 17.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. To exhibit the appearance of (something evil or
      unpleasant) as approaching; to indicate as impending; to
      announce the conditional infliction of; as, to threaten
      war; to threaten death. --Milton.

      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To menace.

   Usage: {Threaten}, {Menace}. Threaten is Anglo-Saxon, and
          menace is Latin. As often happens, the former is the
          more familiar term; the latter is more employed in
          formal style. We are threatened with a drought; the
          country is menaced with war.

                Threatened this moment, and the next implored.

          [1913 Webster]

                Of the sharp ax
                Regardless, that o'er his devoted head
                Hangs menacing.                   --Somerville.
