      <WordDefinition>talk
     
        &lt;chat, tool, networking, messaging&gt; A {Unix} program and
        {protocol} supporting conversation between two or more users
        who may be logged into the same computer or different
        computers on a network.  Variants include {ntalk}, {ytalk},
        and {ports} or {emulators} of these programs for other
        {platforms}.
     
        {Unix} has the {talk} program and {protocol} and its variants
        {xtalk} and {ytalk} for the {X Window System}; {VMS} has
        {phone}; {Windows for Workgroups} has {chat}.  {ITS} also has
        a talk system.  These split the screen into separate areas for
        each user.
     
        {Unix}'s {write} command can also be used, though it does not
        attempt to separate input and output on the screen.
     
        Users of such systems are said to be in {talk mode} which has
        many conventional abbreviations and idioms.  Most of these
        survived into {chat} jargon, but many fell out of common use
        with the migration of {user} prattle from talk-like systems to
        {chat} systems in the early 1990s.  These disused
        talk-specific forms include:
     
        "BYE?" - are you ready to close the conversation?  This is the
        standard way to end a talk-mode conversation; the other person
        types "BYE" to confirm, or else continues the conversation.
     
        "JAM"/"MIN" - just a minute
     
        "O" - "over" (I have stopped talking).  Also "/" as in x/y - x
        over y, or two newlines (the latter being the most common).
     
        "OO" - "over and out" - end of conversation.
     
        "\" - Greek {lambda}.
     
        "R U THERE?" - are you there?
     
        "SEC" - wait a second.
     
        "/\/\/" - laughter.  But on a {MUD}, this usually means
        "earthquake fault".
     
        See also {talk bomb}.
