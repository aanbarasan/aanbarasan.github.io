   Note: This verb is often used with two objects, one of the
         person, the other of the thing; as, he taught me Latin
         grammar. In the passive construction, either of these
         objects may be retained in the objective case, while
         the other becomes the subject; as, I was taught Latin
         grammar by him; Latin grammar was taught me by him.
         [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To instruct; inform; inculcate; tell; guide; counsel;
        admonish. See the Note under {Learn}.
