      <WordDefinition>Thunder
   often referred to in Scripture (Job 40:9; Ps. 77:18; 104:7).
   James and John were called by our Lord "sons of thunder" (Mark
   3:17). In Job 39:19, instead of "thunder," as in the Authorized
   Version, the Revised Version translates (ra'amah) by "quivering
   main" (marg., "shaking"). Thunder accompanied the giving of the
   law at Sinai (Ex. 19:16). It was regarded as the voice of God
   (Job 37:2; Ps. 18:13; 81:7; comp. John 12:29). In answer to
   Samuel's prayer (1 Sam. 12:17, 18), God sent thunder, and "all
   the people greatly feared," for at such a season (the
   wheat-harvest) thunder and rain were almost unknown in
   Palestine.
