        1. &lt;tool&gt; A program used primarily to create, manipulate,
        modify, or analyse other programs, such as a compiler or an
        editor or a cross-referencing program.  Opposite: {app},
        {operating system}.
     
        2. A {Unix} {application program} with a simple, "transparent"
        (typically text-stream) interface designed specifically to be
        used in programmed combination with other tools (see {filter},
        {plumbing}).
     
        3. &lt;jargon&gt; ({MIT}: general to students there) To work; to
        study (connotes tedium).  The {TMRC} Dictionary defined this
        as "to set one's brain to the grindstone".  See {hack}.
     
        4. &lt;jargon, person&gt; ({MIT}) A student who studies too much and
        hacks too little.  MIT's student humour magazine rejoices in
        the name "Tool and Die".
