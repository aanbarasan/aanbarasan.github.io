      <WordDefinition>Tables
   (Mark 7:4) means banqueting-couches or benches, on which the
   Jews reclined when at meals. This custom, along with the use of
   raised tables like ours, was introduced among the Jews after the
   Captivity. Before this they had, properly speaking, no table.
   That which served the purpose was a skin or piece of leather
   spread out on the carpeted floor. Sometimes a stool was placed
   in the middle of this skin. (See ABRAHAM'S {BOSOM};
   {BANQUET}; {MEALS}.)

      <WordDefinition>backgammon \back"gam`mon\, n. [Origin unknown; perhaps fr. Dan.
   bakke tray + E. game; or very likely the first part is from
   E. back, adv., and the game is so called because the men are
   often set back.]
   A game of chance and skill, played by two persons on a
   ``board'' marked off into twenty-four spaces called
   ``points''. Each player has fifteen pieces, or ``men'', the
   movements of which from point to point are determined by
   throwing dice. Formerly called {tables}.
   [1913 Webster]

   {backgammon board}, a board for playing backgammon, often
      made in the form of two rectangular trays hinged together,
      each tray containing two ``tables''.
      [1913 Webster]
