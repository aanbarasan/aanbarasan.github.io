      <WordDefinition>Tires
   "To tire" the head is to adorn it (2 Kings 9:30). As a noun the
   word is derived from "tiara," and is the rendering of the Heb.
   p'er, a "turban" or an ornament for the head (Ezek. 24:17; R.V.,
   "headtire;" 24:23). In Isa. 3:18 the word _saharonim_ is
   rendered "round tires like the moon," and in Judg. 8:21, 26
   "ornaments," but in both cases "crescents" in the Revised
   Version.
