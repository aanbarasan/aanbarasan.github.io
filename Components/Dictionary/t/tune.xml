      <WordDefinition>tune
     
        &lt;jargon&gt; (From musical, possibly via automotive, usage) To
        {optimise} a program or system for a particular environment,
        especially by adjusting numerical parameters designed as
        {hooks} for tuning, e.g. by changing "#define" lines in C.
        One may "tune for time" (fastest execution), "tune for space"
        (least memory use), or "tune for configuration" (most
        efficient use of hardware).
     
        See {bum}, {hot spot}, {hand-hacking}.
