      <WordDefinition>YOKE, n.  An implement, madam, to whose Latin name, _jugum_, we owe
one of the most illuminating words in our language -- a word that
defines the matrimonial situation with precision, point and poignancy. 
A thousand apologies for withholding it.

      <WordDefinition>Yoke
   (1.) Fitted on the neck of oxen for the purpose of binding to
   them the traces by which they might draw the plough, etc. (Num.
   19:2; Deut. 21:3). It was a curved piece of wood called _'ol_.
   
     (2.) In Jer. 27:2; 28:10, 12 the word in the Authorized
   Version rendered "yoke" is _motah_, which properly means a
   "staff," or as in the Revised Version, "bar."
   
     These words in the Hebrew are both used figuratively of severe
   bondage, or affliction, or subjection (Lev. 26:13; 1 Kings 12:4;
   Isa. 47:6; Lam. 1:14; 3:27). In the New Testament the word
   "yoke" is also used to denote servitude (Matt. 11:29, 30; Acts
   15:10; Gal. 5:1).
   
     (3.) In 1 Sam. 11:7, 1 Kings 19:21, Job 1:3 the word thus
   translated is _tzemed_, which signifies a pair, two oxen yoked
   or coupled together, and hence in 1 Sam. 14:14 it represents as
   much land as a yoke of oxen could plough in a day, like the
   Latin _jugum_. In Isa. 5:10 this word in the plural is
   translated "acres."
