      <WordDefinition>YOUTH, n.  The Period of Possibility, when Archimedes finds a fulcrum,
Cassandra has a following and seven cities compete for the honor of
endowing a living Homer.

        Youth is the true Saturnian Reign, the Golden Age on earth
    again, when figs are grown on thistles, and pigs betailed with
    whistles and, wearing silken bristles, live ever in clover, and
    clows fly over, delivering milk at every door, and Justice never
    is heard to snore, and every assassin is made a ghost and,
    howling, is cast into Baltimost!
                                                        Polydore Smith
