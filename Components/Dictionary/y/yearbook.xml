      the statistics or facts of a year, designed to be used as
      a reference book; as, the Congregational Yearbook.

   2. (Eng. Law) A book containing annual reports of cases
      adjudged in the courts of England.

   Note: The Yearbooks are the oldest English reports extant,
         beginning with the reign of Edward II., and ending with
         the reign of Henry VIII. They were published annually,
         and derive their name from that fact. They consist of
         eleven parts, or volumes, are written in Law French,
         and extend over nearly two hundred years. There are,
         however, several hiatuses, or chasms, in the series.
