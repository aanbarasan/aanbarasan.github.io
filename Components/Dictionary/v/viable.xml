      <WordDefinition>Viable \Vi"a*ble\, a. [F., from vie life, L. vita. See {Vital}.]
   (Law)
   Capable of living; born alive and with such form and
   development of organs as to be capable of living; -- said of
   a newborn, or a prematurely born, infant.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Unless he [an infant] is born viable, he acquires no
         rights, and can not transmit them to his heirs, and is
         considered as if he had never been born. --Bouvier.
