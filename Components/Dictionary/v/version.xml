   a translation of the holy Scriptures. This word is not found in
   the Bible, nevertheless, as frequent references are made in this
   work to various ancient as well as modern versions, it is
   fitting that some brief account should be given of the most
   important of these. These versions are important helps to the
   right interpretation of the Word. (See SAMARITAN {PENTATEUCH}.)
   
     1. The Targums. After the return from the Captivity, the Jews,
   no longer familiar with the old Hebrew, required that their
   Scriptures should be translated for them into the Chaldaic or
   Aramaic language and interpreted. These translations and
   paraphrases were at first oral, but they were afterwards reduced
   to writing, and thus targums, i.e., "versions" or
   "translations", have come down to us. The chief of these are,
   (1.) The Onkelos Targum, i.e., the targum of Akelas=Aquila, a
   targum so called to give it greater popularity by comparing it
   with the Greek translation of Aquila mentioned below. This
   targum originated about the second century after Christ. (2.)
   The targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel comes next to that of Onkelos
   in respect of age and value. It is more a paraphrase on the
   Prophets, however, than a translation. Both of these targums
   issued from the Jewish school which then flourished at Babylon.
   
     2. The Greek Versions. (1.) The oldest of these is the
   Septuagint, usually quoted as the LXX. The origin of this the
   most important of all the versions is involved in much
   obscurity. It derives its name from the popular notion that
   seventy-two translators were employed on it by the direction of
   Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, and that it was
   accomplished in seventy-two days, for the use of the Jews
   residing in that country. There is no historical warrant for
   this notion. It is, however, an established fact that this
   version was made at Alexandria; that it was begun about 280
   B.C., and finished about 200 or 150 B.C.; that it was the work
   of a number of translators who differed greatly both in their
   knowledge of Hebrew and of Greek; and that from the earliest
   times it has borne the name of "The Septuagint", i.e., The
   Seventy.
   
     "This version, with all its defects, must be of the greatest
   interest, (a) as preserving evidence for the text far more
   ancient than the oldest Hebrew manuscripts; (b) as the means by
   which the Greek Language was wedded to Hebrew thought; (c) as
   the source of the great majority of quotations from the Old
   Testament by writers of the New Testament.
   
     (2.) The New Testament manuscripts fall into two divisions,
   Uncials, written in Greek capitals, with no distinction at all
   between the different words, and very little even between the
   different lines; and Cursives, in small Greek letters, and with
   divisions of words and lines. The change between the two kinds
   of Greek writing took place about the tenth century. Only five
   manuscripts of the New Testament approaching to completeness are
   more ancient than this dividing date. The first, numbered A, is
   the Alexandrian manuscript. Though brought to this country by
   Cyril Lucar, patriarch of Constantinople, as a present to
   Charles I., it is believed that it was written, not in that
   capital, but in Alexandria; whence its title. It is now dated in
   the fifth century A.D. The second, known as B, is the Vatican
   manuscript. (See {VATICANUS}.) The Third, C, or the
   Ephraem manuscript, was so called because it was written over
   the writings of Ephraem, a Syrian theological author, a practice
   very common in the days when writing materials were scarce and
   dear. It is believed that it belongs to the fifth century, and
   perhaps a slightly earlier period of it than the manuscript A.
   The fourth, D, or the manuscript of Beza, was so called because
   it belonged to the reformer Beza, who found it in the monastery
   of St. Irenaeus at Lyons in 1562 A.D. It is imperfect, and is
   dated in the sixth century. The fifth (called Aleph) is the
   Sinaitic manuscript. (See {SINAITICUS}.)
   
     3. The Syriac Versions. (See {SYRIAC}.)
   
     4. The Latin Versions. A Latin version of the Scriptures,
   called the "Old Latin," which originated in North Africa, was in
   common use in the time of Tertullian (A.D. 150). Of this there
   appear to have been various copies or recensions made. That made
   in Italy, and called the Itala, was reckoned the most accurate.
   This translation of the Old Testament seems to have been made
   not from the original Hebrew but from the LXX.
   
     This version became greatly corrupted by repeated
   transcription, and to remedy the evil Jerome (A.D. 329-420) was
   requested by Damasus, the bishop of Rome, to undertake a
   complete revision of it. It met with opposition at first, but
   was at length, in the seventh century, recognized as the
   "Vulgate" version. It appeared in a printed from about A.D.
   1455, the first book that ever issued from the press. The
   Council of Trent (1546) declared it "authentic." It subsequently
   underwent various revisions, but that which was executed (1592)
   under the sanction of Pope Clement VIII. was adopted as the
   basis of all subsequent editions. It is regarded as the sacred
   original in the Roman Catholic Church. All modern European
   versions have been more or less influenced by the Vulgate. This
   version reads _ipsa_ instead of _ipse_ in Gen. 3:15, "She shall
   bruise thy head."
   
     5. There are several other ancient versions which are of
   importance for Biblical critics, but which we need not mention
   particularly, such as the Ethiopic, in the fourth century, from
   the LXX.; two Egyptian versions, about the fourth century, the
   Memphitic, circulated in Lower Egypt, and the Thebaic, designed
   for Upper Egypt, both from the Greek; the Gothic, written in the
   German language, but with the Greek alphabet, by Ulphilas (died
   A.D. 388), of which only fragments of the Old Testament remain;
   the Armenian, about A.D. 400; and the Slavonic, in the ninth
   century, for ancient Moravia. Other ancient versions, as the
   Arabic, the Persian, and the Anglo-Saxon, may be mentioned.
   
     6. The history of the English versions begins properly with
   Wyckliffe. Portions, however, of the Scriptures were rendered
   into Saxon (as the Gospel according to John, by Bede, A.D. 735),
   and also into English (by Orme, called the "Ormulum," a portion
   of the Gospels and of the Acts in the form of a metrical
   paraphrase, toward the close of the seventh century), long
   before Wyckliffe; but it is to him that the honour belongs of
   having first rendered the whole Bible into English (A.D. 1380).
   This version was made from the Vulgate, and renders Gen. 3:15
   after that Version, "She shall trede thy head."
   
     This was followed by Tyndale's translation (1525-1531); Miles
   Coverdale's (1535-1553); Thomas Matthew's (1537), really,
   however, the work of John Rogers, the first martyr under the
   reign of Queen Mary. This was properly the first Authorized
   Version, Henry VIII. having ordered a copy of it to be got for
   every church. This took place in less than a year after Tyndale
   was martyred for the crime of translating the Scriptures. In
   1539 Richard Taverner published a revised edition of Matthew's
   Bible. The Great Bible, so called from its great size, called
   also Cranmer's Bible, was published in 1539 and 1568. In the
   strict sense, the "Great Bible" is "the only authorized version;
   for the Bishops' Bible and the present Bible [the A.V.] never
   had the formal sanction of royal authority." Next in order was
   the Geneva version (1557-1560); the Bishops' Bible (1568); the
   Rheims and Douai versions, under Roman Catholic auspices (1582,
   1609); the Authorized Version (1611); and the Revised Version of
   the New Testament in 1880 and of the Old Testament in 1884.

      <WordDefinition>version
     
        &lt;programming&gt; One of a sequence of copies of a program, each
        incorporating new modifications.  Each version is usually
        identified by a number, commonly of the form X.Y where X is
        the major version number and Y is the release number.
        Typically an increment in X (with Y reset to zero) signifies a
        substantial increase in the function of the program or a
        partial or total re-implementation, whereas Y increases each
        time the progam is changed in any way and re-released.
     
        Version numbers are useful so that the user can know if the
        program has changed ({bug}s have been fixed or new functions
        added) since he obtained his copy and the programmer can tell
        if a bug report relates to the current version.  It is thus
        always important to state the version when reporting bugs.
        Statements about compatibility between different software
        components should always say which versions they apply to.
