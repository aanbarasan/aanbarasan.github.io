   cf. F. visuel. See {Vision}.]
   1. Of or pertaining to sight; used in sight; serving as the
      instrument of seeing; as, the visual nerve.
      [1913 Webster]

            The air,
            Nowhere so clear, sharpened his visual ray.
                                                  --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

      of sight, or the eye.

   {Visual purple} (Physiol.), a photochemical substance, of a
      purplish red color, contained in the retina of human eyes
      and in the eyes of most animals. It is quickly bleached by
      light, passing through the colors, red, orange, and
      yellow, and then disappearing. Also called {rhodopsin},
      and {vision purple}. See {Optography}.

   {Visual white} (Physiol.), the final product in the action of

      epithelium.

   {Visual yellow} (Physiol.), a product intermediate between
      visual purple and visual white, formed in the
      photochemical action of light on visual purple.
