      <WordDefinition>Variable \Va"ri*a*ble\, n.
   1. That which is variable; that which varies, or is subject
      to change.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Math.) A quantity which may increase or decrease; a
      quantity which admits of an infinite number of values in
      the same expression; a variable quantity; as, in the
      equation x^{2} - y^{2} = R^{2}, x and y are variables.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. (Naut.)
      (a) A shifting wind, or one that varies in force.
      (b) pl. Those parts of the sea where a steady wind is not
          expected, especially the parts between the trade-wind
          belts.
          [1913 Webster]

   {Independent variable} (Math.), that one of two or more
      variables, connected with each other in any way whatever,
      to which changes are supposed to be given at will. Thus,
      in the equation x^{2} - y^{2} = R^{2}, if arbitrary
      changes are supposed to be given to x, then x is the
      independent variable, and y is called a function of x.
      There may be two or more independent variables in an
      equation or problem. Cf. {Dependent variable}, under
      {Dependent}.
