      <WordDefinition>Virgin
   In a prophecy concerning our Lord, Isaiah (7:14) says, "A virgin
   [R.V. marg., 'the virgin'] shall conceive, and bear a son"
   (comp. Luke 1:31-35). The people of the land of Zidon are thus
   referred to by Isaiah (23:12), "O thou oppressed virgin,
   daughter of Zidon;" and of the people of Israel, Jeremiah
   (18:13) says, "The virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible
   thing."
