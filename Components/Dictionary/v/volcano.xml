      <WordDefinition>Volcano \Vol*ca"no\, n.; pl. {Volcanoes}. [It. volcano, vulcano,
   fr. L. Vulcanus Vulkan, the god of fire. See {Vulkan}.]
   (Geol.)
   A mountain or hill, usually more or less conical in form,
   from which lava, cinders, steam, sulphur gases, and the like,
   are ejected; -- often popularly called a {burning mountain}.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Volcanoes include many of the most conspicuous and
         lofty mountains of the earth, as Mt. Vesuvius in Italy
         (4,000 ft. high), Mt. Loa in Hawaii (14,000 ft.),
         Cotopaxi in South America (nearly 20,000 ft.), which
         are examples of active volcanoes. The crater of a
         volcano is usually a pit-shaped cavity, often of great
         size. The summit crater of Mt. Loa has a maximum length
         of 13,000 ft., and a depth of nearly 800 feet. Beside
         the chief crater, a volcano may have a number of
         subordinate craters.
         [1913 Webster]
