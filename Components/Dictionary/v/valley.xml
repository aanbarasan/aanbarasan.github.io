      <WordDefinition>Valley
   (1.) Heb. bik'ah, a "cleft" of the mountains (Deut. 8:7; 11:11;
   Ps. 104:8; Isa. 41:18); also a low plain bounded by mountains,
   as the plain of Lebanon at the foot of Hermon around the sources
   of the Jordan (Josh. 11:17; 12:7), and the valley of Megiddo (2
   Chr. 35:22).
   
     (2.) 'Emek, "deep;" "a long, low plain" (Job 39:10, 21; Ps.
   65:13; Cant. 2:1), such as the plain of Esdraelon; the "valley
   of giants" (Josh. 15:8), usually translated "valley of Rephaim"
   (2 Sam. 5:18); of Elah (1 Sam. 17:2), of Berachah (2 Chr.
   20:26); the king's "dale" (Gen. 14:17); of Jehoshaphat (Joel
   3:2, 12), of Achor (Josh. 7:24; Isa. 65:10), Succoth (Ps. 60:6),
   Ajalon (Josh. 10:12), Jezreel (Hos. 1:5).
   
     (3.) Ge, "a bursting," a "flowing together," a narrow glen or
   ravine, such as the valley of the children of Hinnom (2 Kings
   23:10); of Eshcol (Deut. 1:24); of Sorek (Judg. 16:4), etc.
   
     The "valley of vision" (Isa. 22:1) is usually regarded as
   denoting Jerusalem, which "may be so called," says Barnes (Com.
   on Isa.), "either (1) because there were several valleys within
   the city and adjacent to it, as the vale between Mount Zion and
   Moriah, the vale between Mount Moriah and Mount Ophel, between
   these and Mount Bezetha, and the valley of Jehoshaphat, the
   valley of the brook Kidron, etc., without the walls of the city;
   or (2) more probably it was called the valley in reference to
   its being compassed with hills rising to a considerable
   elevation above the city" (Ps. 125:2; comp. also Jer. 21:13,
   where Jerusalem is called a "valley").
   
     (4.) Heb. nahal, a wady or water-course (Gen. 26:19; Cant.
   6:11).
