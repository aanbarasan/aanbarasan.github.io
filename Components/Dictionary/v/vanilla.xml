      <WordDefinition>vanilla
     
        1. (Default flavour of ice cream in the US) Ordinary
        {flavour}, standard.  When used of food, very often does not
        mean that the food is flavoured with vanilla extract!  For
        example, "vanilla wonton soup" means ordinary wonton soup, as
        opposed to hot-and-sour wonton soup.  Applied to hardware and
        software, as in "Vanilla {Version 7} {Unix} can't run on a
        vanilla {PDP 11}/34."  Also used to orthogonalise chip
        nomenclature; for instance, a 74V00 means what TI calls a
        7400, as distinct from a 74LS00, etc.  This word differs from
        {canonical} in that the latter means "default", whereas
        vanilla simply means "ordinary".  For example, when hackers go
        to a chinese restaurant, hot-and-sour wonton soup is the
        {canonical} wonton soup to get (because that is what most of
        them usually order) even though it isn't the vanilla wonton
        soup.

      <WordDefinition>Vanilla \Va*nil"la\, n. [NL., fr. Sp. vainilla, dim. of Sp.

   seeds, are contained in little pods.]

      {Vanilla claviculata}, remarkable for their delicate and
      agreeable odor, for the volatile, odoriferous oil

      the capsules, extensively used in confectionery,
      perfumery, etc.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: As a medicine, vanilla is supposed to possess powers
         analogous to valerian, while, at the same time, it is
         far more grateful.

      <WordDefinition>vanilla adj. [from the default flavor of ice cream in the U.S.]
   Ordinary {flavor}, standard. When used of food, very often does not mean
   that the food is flavored with vanilla extract! For example, `vanilla
   wonton soup' means ordinary wonton soup, as opposed to hot-and-sour
   wonton soup. Applied to hardware and software, as in "Vanilla Version 7
   Unix can't run on a vanilla 11/34." Also used to orthogonalize chip
   nomenclature; for instance, a 74V00 means what TI calls a 7400, as
   distinct from a 74LS00, etc. This word differs from {canonical} in that
   the latter means `default', whereas vanilla simply means `ordinary'. For
   example, when hackers go on a {great-wall}, hot-and-sour soup is the
   {canonical} soup to get (because that is what most of them usually
   order) even though it isn't the vanilla (wonton) soup.
