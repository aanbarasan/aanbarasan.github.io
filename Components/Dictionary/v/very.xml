   Note: Very is sometimes used to make the word with which it
         is connected emphatic, and may then be paraphrased by
         same, self-same, itself, and the like. ``The very hand,
         the very words.'' --Shak. ``The very rats instinctively
         have quit it.'' --Shak. ``Yea, there where very
         desolation dwells.'' --Milton. Very is used
         occasionally in the comparative degree, and more
         frequently in the superlative. ``Was not my lord the
         verier wag of the two?'' --Shak. ``The veriest hermit
         in the nation.'' --Pope. ``He had spoken the very
         truth, and transformed it into the veriest falsehood.''
         --Hawthorne.
         [1913 Webster]
