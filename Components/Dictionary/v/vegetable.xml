   {Vegetable kingdom} (Nat. Hist.), that primary division of
      living things which includes all plants. The classes of
      the vegetable kingdom have been grouped differently by
      various botanists. The following is one of the best of the
      many arrangements of the principal subdivisions.
      [1913 Webster] I. {Ph[ae]nogamia} (called also
      {Phanerogamia}). Plants having distinct flowers and true
      seeds. [ 1. {Dicotyledons} (called also {Exogens}). --
      Seeds with two or more cotyledons. Stems with the pith,
      woody fiber, and bark concentrically arranged. Divided
      into two subclasses: {Angiosperms}, having the woody fiber
      interspersed with dotted or annular ducts, and the seed
      contained in a true ovary; {Gymnosperms}, having few or no
      ducts in the woody fiber, and the seeds naked. 2.
      {Monocotyledons} (called also {Endogens}). -- Seeds with
      single cotyledon. Stems with slender bundles of woody
      fiber not concentrically arranged, and with no true bark.]
      [1913 Webster] II. {Cryptogamia}. Plants without true
      flowers, and reproduced by minute spores of various kinds,
      or by simple cell division. [ 1. {Acrogens}. -- Plants
      usually with distinct stems and leaves, existing in two
      alternate conditions, one of which is nonsexual and
      sporophoric, the other sexual and o["o]phoric. Divided
      into {Vascular Acrogens}, or {Pteridophyta}, having the
      sporophoric plant conspicuous and consisting partly of
      vascular tissue, as in Ferns, Lycopods, and Equiseta, and
      {Cellular Acrogens}, or {Bryophyta}, having the sexual
      plant most conspicuous, but destitute of vascular tissue,
      as in Mosses and Scale Mosses. 2. {Thallogens}. -- Plants
      without distinct stem and leaves, consisting of a simple
      or branched mass of cellular tissue, or educed to a single
      cell. Reproduction effected variously. Divided into
      {Alg[ae]}, which contain chlorophyll or its equivalent,
      and which live upon air and water, and {Fungi}, which
      contain no chlorophyll, and live on organic matter.
      (Lichens are now believed to be fungi parasitic on
      included alg[ae].]
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Many botanists divide the Ph[ae]nogamia primarily into
         Gymnosperms and Angiosperms, and the latter into
         Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons. Others consider
         Pteridophyta and Bryophyta to be separate classes.
         Thallogens are variously divided by different writers,
         and the places for diatoms, slime molds, and stoneworts
         are altogether uncertain.

         Vocabulary.

      <WordDefinition>Vegetable \Veg"e*ta*ble\, n.
   1. (Biol.) A plant. See {Plant}.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. A plant used or cultivated for food for man or domestic
      animals, as the cabbage, turnip, potato, bean, dandelion,
      etc.; also, the edible part of such a plant, as prepared
      for market or the table.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. a person who has permanently lost consciousness, due to
      damage to the brain, but remains alive; sometimes
      continued life requires support by machinery such as
      breathing tubes. Such a person is said to be in a
      vegetative state.
      [PJC]

   Note: Vegetables and fruits are sometimes loosely
         distinguished by the usual need of cooking the former
         for the use of man, while the latter may be eaten raw;
         but the distinction often fails, as in the case of
         quinces, barberries, and other fruits, and lettuce,
         celery, and other vegetables. Tomatoes if cooked are
         vegetables, if eaten raw are fruits.
