      <WordDefinition>Vinegar
   Heb. hometz, Gr. oxos, Fr. vin aigre; i.e., "sour wine." The
   Hebrew word is rendered vinegar in Ps. 69:21, a prophecy
   fulfilled in the history of the crucifixion (Matt. 27:34). This
   was the common sour wine (posea) daily made use of by the Roman
   soldiers. They gave it to Christ, not in derision, but from
   compassion, to assuage his thirst. Prov. 10:26 shows that there
   was also a stronger vinegar, which was not fit for drinking. The
   comparison, "vinegar upon nitre," probably means "vinegar upon
   soda" (as in the marg. of the R.V.), which then effervesces.
