      <WordDefinition>Verse \Verse\, n. [OE. vers, AS. fers, L. versus a line in
   writing, and, in poetry, a verse, from vertere, versum, to
   turn, to turn round; akin to E. worth to become: cf. F. vers.
   See {Worth} to become, and cf. {Advertise}, {Averse},
   {Controversy}, {Convert}, {Divers}, {Invert}, {Obverse},
   {Prose}, {Suzerain}, {Vortex}.]
   1. A line consisting of a certain number of metrical feet
      (see {Foot}, n., 9) disposed according to metrical rules.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Verses are of various kinds, as hexameter, pentameter,
         tetrameter, etc., according to the number of feet in
         each. A verse of twelve syllables is called an
         Alexandrine. Two or more verses form a stanza or
         strophe.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. Metrical arrangement and language; that which is composed
      in metrical form; versification; poetry.
      [1913 Webster]

            Flowed from their lips in prose or numerous verse.
                                                  --Milton.

      [1913 Webster]
      (a) A stanza; a stave; as, a hymn of four verses.
          [1913 Webster]

   Note: Although this use of verse is common, it is
         objectionable, because not always distinguishable from
         the stricter use in the sense of a line.

         divided into verses by Robert Stephens [or Estienne], a
         French printer. This arrangement appeared for the first
         time in an edition printed at Geneva, in 1551.
         [1913 Webster]
