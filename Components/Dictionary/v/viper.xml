      <WordDefinition>Viper
   In Job 20:16, Isa. 30:6; 59:5, the Heb. word eph'eh is thus
   rendered. The Hebrew word, however, probably denotes a species
   of poisonous serpents known by the Arabic name of 'el ephah.
   Tristram has identified it with the sand viper, a species of
   small size common in sandy regions, and frequently found under
   stones by the shores of the Dead Sea. It is rapid in its
   movements, and highly poisonous. In the New Testament _echidne_
   is used (Matt. 3:7; 12:34; 23:33) for any poisonous snake. The
   viper mentioned in Acts 28:3 was probably the vipera aspis, or
   the Mediterranean viper. (See {ADDER}.)
