      <WordDefinition>Flesh
   in the Old Testament denotes (1) a particular part of the body
   of man and animals (Gen. 2:21; 41:2; Ps. 102:5, marg.); (2) the
   whole body (Ps. 16:9); (3) all living things having flesh, and
   particularly humanity as a whole (Gen. 6:12, 13); (4) mutability
   and weakness (2 Chr. 32:8; comp. Isa. 31:3; Ps. 78:39). As
   suggesting the idea of softness it is used in the expression
   "heart of flesh" (Ezek. 11:19). The expression "my flesh and
   bone" (Judg. 9:2; Isa. 58:7) denotes relationship.
   
     In the New Testament, besides these it is also used to denote
   the sinful element of human nature as opposed to the "Spirit"
   (Rom. 6:19; Matt. 16:17). Being "in the flesh" means being
   unrenewed (Rom. 7:5; 8:8, 9), and to live "according to the
   flesh" is to live and act sinfully (Rom. 8:4, 5, 7, 12).
   
     This word also denotes the human nature of Christ (John 1:14,
   "The Word was made flesh." Comp. also 1 Tim. 3:16; Rom. 1:3).
