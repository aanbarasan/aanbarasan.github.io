        message that you have received on to one or more other
        {addressees}.  Most e-mail systems can be configured to do
        this automatically to all or certain messages, e.g. {Unix}
        {sendmail} looks for a ".forward" file in the recipient's
        {home directory}.
     
        A {mailing list} server (or "{mail exploder}") is designed to
        forward messages automatically to lists of people.
