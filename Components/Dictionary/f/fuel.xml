      <WordDefinition>Fuel
   Almost every kind of combustible matter was used for fuel, such
   as the withered stalks of herbs (Matt. 6:30), thorns (Ps. 58:9;
   Eccl. 7:6), animal excrements (Ezek. 4:12-15; 15:4, 6; 21:32).
   Wood or charcoal is much used still in all the towns of Syria
   and Egypt. It is largely brought from the region of Hebron to
   Jerusalem. (See {COAL}.)
