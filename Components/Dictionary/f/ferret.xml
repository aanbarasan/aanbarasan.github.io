      <WordDefinition>Ferret
   Lev. 11:30 (R.V., "gecko"), one of the unclean creeping things.
   It was perhaps the Lacerta gecko which was intended by the
   Hebrew word (anakah, a cry, "mourning," the creature which
   groans) here used, i.e., the "fan-footed" lizard, the gecko
   which makes a mournful wail. The LXX. translate it by a word
   meaning "shrew-mouse," of which there are three species in
   Palestine. The Rabbinical writers regard it as the hedgehog. The
   translation of the Revised Version is to be preferred.
