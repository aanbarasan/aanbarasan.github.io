      <WordDefinition>Frost
   (Heb. kerah, from its smoothness) Job 37:10 (R.V., "ice"); Gen.
   31:40; Jer. 36:30; rendered "ice" in Job 6:16, 38:29; and
   "crystal" in Ezek. 1:22. "At the present day frost is entirely
   unknown in the lower portions of the valley of the Jordan, but
   slight frosts are sometimes felt on the sea-coast and near
   Lebanon." Throughout Western Asia cold frosty nights are
   frequently succeeded by warm days.
   
     "Hoar frost" (Heb. kephor, so called from its covering the
   ground) is mentioned in Ex. 16:14; Job 38:29; Ps. 147:16.
   
     In Ps. 78:47 the word rendered "frost" (R.V. marg., "great
   hail-stones"), _hanamal_, occurs only there. It is rendered by
   Gesenius, the Hebrew lexicographer, "ant," and so also by
   others, but the usual interpretation derived from the ancient
   versions may be maintained.
