      <WordDefinition>Fold
   an enclosure for flocks to rest together (Isa. 13:20).
   Sheep-folds are mentioned Num. 32:16, 24, 36; 2 Sam. 7:8; Zeph.
   2:6; John 10:1, etc. It was prophesied of the cities of Ammon
   (Ezek. 25:5), Aroer (Isa. 17:2), and Judaea, that they would be
   folds or couching-places for flocks. "Among the pots," of the
   Authorized Version (Ps. 68:13), is rightly in the Revised
   Version, "among the sheepfolds."
