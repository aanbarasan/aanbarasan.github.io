      <WordDefinition>followup
     
        On {Usenet}, a {posting} generated in response to another
        posting (as opposed to a {reply}, which goes by e-mail rather
        than being broadcast).  Followups include the ID of the
        {parent message} in their headers; smart news-readers can use
        this information to present {Usenet} news in "conversation"
        sequence rather than order-of-arrival.  See {thread}.

      <WordDefinition>follow-up \follow-up\ n.
   1. a second (or subsequent) action to increase the
      effectiveness of an initial action. Also used
      attributively; as a follow-up visit.

   Note: A follow-up may be of various types. After a medical
         examination, a second examination (or {reexamination})
         to obtain additional information regarding some fact
         discovered in the first examination is considered a
         follow-up. A second visit or phone call in pursuit of a
         sale or other request would also be a follow-up.

   Syn: reexamination, review.
        [WordNet 1.5 +PJC]

   2. (Journalism) A subsequent story providing information
      discovered or events happening after a first story was
      published.
      [PJC]

   3. (Journalism) Same as {sidebar}.
