   Introduction France
   -------------------
                            Background: Although ultimately a victor in
                                        World Wars I and II, France suffered
                                        extensive losses in its empire,
                                        wealth, manpower, and rank as a
                                        dominant nation-state. Nevertheless,
                                        France today is one of the most
                                        modern countries in the world and is
                                        a leader among European nations.
                                        Since 1958, it has constructed a
                                        presidential democracy resistant to
                                        the instabilities experienced in
                                        earlier parliamentary democracies.
                                        In recent years, its reconciliation
                                        and cooperation with Germany have
                                        proved central to the economic
                                        integration of Europe, including the
                                        advent of the euro in January 1999.
                                        Presently, France is at the
                                        forefront of European states seeking
                                        to exploit the momentum of monetary
                                        union to advance the creation of a
                                        more unified and capable European
                                        defense and security apparatus.

   Economy France
   --------------
                    Economy - overview: France is in the midst of
                                        transition, from a well-to-do modern
                                        economy that featured extensive
                                        government ownership and
                                        intervention to one that relies more
                                        on market mechanisms. The Socialist-
                                        led government has partially or
                                        fully privatized many large
                                        companies, banks, and insurers, but
                                        still retains large stakes in
                                        several leading firms, including Air
                                        France, France Telecom, Renault, and
                                        Thales, and remains dominant in some
                                        sectors, particularly power, public
                                        transport, and defense industries.
                                        The telecommunications sector is
                                        gradually being opened to
                                        competition. France's leaders remain
                                        committed to a capitalism in which
                                        they maintain social equity by means
                                        of laws, tax policies, and social
                                        spending that reduce income
                                        disparity and the impact of free
                                        markets on public health and
                                        welfare. The current government has
                                        lowered income taxes and introduced
                                        measures to boost employment, but
                                        has done little to reform an overly
                                        expensive pension system, rigid
                                        labor market, and restrictive
                                        bureaucracy that discourage hiring
                                        and make the tax burden one of the
                                        highest in Europe. In addition to
                                        the tax burden, the reduction of the
                                        workweek to 35 hours, which is to be
                                        extended to small firms in 2002, has
                                        drawn criticism for lowering the
                                        competitiveness of French
                                        businesses. The current economic
                                        slowdown has thrown the government's
                                        goal of balancing the budget by 2004
                                        off track.
