      <WordDefinition>FORTH
     
        1. &lt;language&gt; An interactive extensible language using
        {postfix syntax} and a data stack, developed by Charles
        H. Moore in the 1960s.  FORTH is highly user-configurable and
        there are many different implementations, the following
        description is of a typical default configuration.
     
        Forth programs are structured as lists of "words" - FORTH's
        term which encompasses language keywords, primitives and
        user-defined {subroutines}.  Forth takes the idea of
        subroutines to an extreme - nearly everything is a subroutine.
        A word is any string of characters except the separator which
        defaults to space.  Numbers are treated specially.  Words are
        read one at a time from the input stream and either executed
        immediately ("interpretive execution") or compiled as part of
        the definition of a new word.
     
        The sequential nature of list execution and the implicit use
        of the data stack (numbers appearing in the lists are pushed
        to the stack as they are encountered) imply postfix syntax.
        Although postfix notation is initially difficult, experienced
        users find it simple and efficient.
     
        Words appearing in executable lists may be "{primitives}"
        (simple {assembly language} operations), names of previously
        compiled procedures or other special words.  A procedure
        definition is introduced by ":" and ended with ";" and is
        compiled as it is read.
     
        Most Forth dialects include the source language structures
        BEGIN-AGAIN, BEGIN-WHILE-REPEAT, BEGIN-UNTIL, DO-LOOP, and
        IF-ELSE-THEN, and others can be added by the user.  These are
        "compiling structures" which may only occur in a procedure
        definition.
     
        FORTH can include in-line {assembly language} between "CODE"
        and "ENDCODE" or similar constructs.  Forth primitives are
        written entirely in {assembly language}, secondaries contain a
        mixture.  In fact code in-lining is the basis of compilation
        in some implementations.
     
        Once assembled, primitives are used exactly like other words.
        A significant difference in behaviour can arise, however, from
        the fact that primitives end with a jump to "NEXT", the entry
        point of some code called the sequencer, whereas
        non-primitives end with the address of the "EXIT" primitive.
        The EXIT code includes the scheduler in some {multi-tasking}
        systems so a process can be {deschedule}d after executing a
        non-primitive, but not after a primitive.
     
        Forth implementations differ widely.  Implementation
        techniques include {threaded code}, dedicated Forth
        processors, {macros} at various levels, or interpreters
        written in another language such as {C}.  Some implementations
        provide {real-time} response, user-defined data structures,
        {multitasking}, {floating-point} arithmetic, and/or {virtual
        memory}.
     
        Some Forth systems support virtual memory without specific
        hardware support like {MMU}s.  However, Forth virtual memory
        is usually only a sort of extended data space and does not
        usually support executable code.
     
        FORTH does not distinguish between {operating system} calls
        and the language.  Commands relating to I/O, {file systems}
        and {virtual memory} are part of the same language as the
        words for arithmetic, memory access, loops, IF statements, and
        the user's application.
     
        Many Forth systems provide user-declared "vocabularies" which
        allow the same word to have different meanings in different
        contexts.  Within one vocabulary, re-defining a word causes
        the previous definition to be hidden from the interpreter (and
        therefore the compiler), but not from previous definitions.
     
        FORTH was first used to guide the telescope at NRAO, Kitt
        Peak.  Moore considered it to be a {fourth-generation
        language} but his {operating system} wouldn't let him use six
        letters in a program name, so FOURTH became FORTH.
     
        Versions include fig-FORTH, FORTH 79 and FORTH 83.
