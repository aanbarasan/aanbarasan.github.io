      <WordDefinition>Flag
   (Heb., or rather Egyptian, ahu, Job 8:11), rendered "meadow" in
   Gen. 41:2, 18; probably the Cyperus esculentus, a species of
   rush eaten by cattle, the Nile reed. It also grows in Palestine.
   
     In Ex. 2:3, 5, Isa. 19:6, it is the rendering of the Hebrew
   _suph_, a word which occurs frequently in connection with _yam_;
   as _yam suph_, to denote the "Red Sea" (q.v.) or the sea of
   weeds (as this word is rendered, Jonah 2:5). It denotes some
   kind of sedge or reed which grows in marshy places. (See PAPER
   ï¿½T0002840, {REED}.)
