      <WordDefinition>Flowers
   Very few species of flowers are mentioned in the Bible although
   they abounded in Palestine. It has been calculated that in
   Western Syria and Palestine from two thousand to two thousand
   five hundred plants are found, of which about five hundred
   probably are British wild-flowers. Their beauty is often alluded
   to (Cant. 2:12; Matt. 6:28). They are referred to as affording
   an emblem of the transitory nature of human life (Job 14:2; Ps.
   103:15; Isa. 28:1; 40:6; James 1:10). Gardens containing flowers
   and fragrant herbs are spoken of (Cant. 4:16; 6:2).
