      <WordDefinition>Foreigner
   a Gentile. Such as resided among the Hebrews were required by
   the law to be treated with kindness (Ex. 22:21; 23:9; Lev.
   19:33, 34; 23:22; Deut. 14:28; 16:10, 11; 24:19). They enjoyed
   in many things equal rights with the native-born residents (Ex.
   12:49; Lev. 24:22; Num. 15:15; 35:15), but were not allowed to
   do anything which was an abomination according to the Jewish law
   (Ex. 20:10; Lev. 17:15,16; 18:26; 20:2; 24:16, etc.).
