      <WordDefinition>Facility \Fa*cil"i*ty\ (f[.a]*s[i^]l"[i^]*t[y^]), n.; pl.
   {Facilities} (f[.a]*s[i^]l"[i^]*t[i^]z). [L. facilitas, fr.
   facilis easy: cf. F. facilit['e]. See {Facile}.]
   1. The quality of being easily performed; freedom from
      difficulty; ease; as, the facility of an operation.
      [1913 Webster]

            The facility with which government has been

      [1913 Webster]

   2. Ease in performance; readiness proceeding from skill or
      use; dexterity; as, practice gives a wonderful facility in
      executing works of art.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Easiness to be persuaded; readiness or compliance; --
      usually in a bad sense; pliancy.
      [1913 Webster]

            It is a great error to take facility for good
            nature.                               --L'Estrange.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. Easiness of access; complaisance; affability.
      [1913 Webster]

            Offers himself to the visits of a friend with
            facility.                             --South.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. That which promotes the ease of any action or course of
      conduct; advantage; aid; assistance; -- usually in the
      plural; as, special facilities for study.

   Syn: Ease; expertness; readiness; dexterity; complaisance;
        condescension; affability.

   Usage: {Facility}, {Expertness}, {Readiness}. These words
          have in common the idea of performing any act with
          ease and promptitude. Facility supposes a natural or
          acquired power of dispatching a task with lightness
          and ease. Expertness is the kind of facility acquired
          by long practice. Readiness marks the promptitude with
          which anything is done. A merchant needs great
          facility in dispatching business; a banker, great
          expertness in casting accounts; both need great
          readiness in passing from one employment to another.
          ``The facility which we get of doing things by a
          custom of doing, makes them often pass in us without
          our notice.'' --Locke. ``The army was celebrated for
          the expertness and valor of the soldiers.'' ``A
          readiness to obey the known will of God is the surest
          means to enlighten the mind in respect to duty.''
          [1913 Webster]
