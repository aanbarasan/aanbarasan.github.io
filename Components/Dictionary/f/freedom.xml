      <WordDefinition>FREEDOM, n.  Exemption from the stress of authority in a beggarly half
dozen of restraint's infinite multitude of methods.  A political
condition that every nation supposes itself to enjoy in virtual
monopoly.  Liberty.  The distinction between freedom and liberty is
not accurately known; naturalists have never been able to find a
living specimen of either.

    Freedom, as every schoolboy knows,
        Once shrieked as Kosciusko fell;
    On every wind, indeed, that blows
            I hear her yell.

    She screams whenever monarchs meet,
        And parliaments as well,
    To bind the chains about her feet
            And toll her knell.

    And when the sovereign people cast
        The votes they cannot spell,
    Upon the pestilential blast
            Her clamors swell.

    For all to whom the power's given
        To sway or to compel,
    Among themselves apportion Heaven
            And give her Hell.
                                                          Blary O'Gary

      <WordDefinition>Freedom
   The law of Moses pointed out the cases in which the servants of
   the Hebrews were to receive their freedom (Ex. 21:2-4, 7, 8;
   Lev. 25:39-42, 47-55; Deut. 15:12-18). Under the Roman law the
   "freeman" (ingenuus) was one born free; the "freedman"
   (libertinus) was a manumitted slave, and had not equal rights
   with the freeman (Acts 22:28; comp. Acts 16:37-39; 21:39; 22:25;
   25:11, 12).
