      <WordDefinition>farming n. [Adelaide University, Australia] What the heads of a disk
   drive are said to do when they plow little furrows in the magnetic
   media. Associated with a {crash}. Typically used as follows: "Oh no, the
   machine has just crashed; I hope the hard drive hasn't gone {farming}
   again." No longer common; modern drives automatically park their heads
   in a safe zone on power-down, so it takes a real mechanical problem to
   induce this.
