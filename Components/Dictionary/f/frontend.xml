      <WordDefinition>front end
     
        1. An intermediary computer that does set-up and filtering for
        another (usually more powerful but less friendly) machine (a
        "back end").
     
        2. Software that provides an interface to another program
        "behind" it, which may not be as {user-friendly}.  Probably
        from analogy with hardware front-ends that interfaced with
        {mainframe}s.

      <WordDefinition>front end n. 1. An intermediary computer that does set-up and filtering
   for another (usually more powerful but less friendly) machine (a `back
   end'). 2. What you're talking to when you have a conversation with
   someone who is making replies without paying attention. "Look at the
   dancing elephants!" "Uh-huh." "Do you know what I just said?" "Sorry,
   you were talking to the front end." 3. Software that provides an
   interface to another program `behind' it, which may not be as
   user-friendly. Probably from analogy with hardware front-ends (see sense
   1) that interfaced with mainframes.
