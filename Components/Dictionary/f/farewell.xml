      <WordDefinition>Farewell \Fare`well"\, interj. [Fare (thou, you) + well.]
   Go well; good-by; adieu; -- originally applied to a person
   departing, but by custom now applied both to those who depart
   and those who remain. It is often separated by the pronoun;
   as, fare you well; and is sometimes used as an expression of
   separation only; as, farewell the year; farewell, ye sweet
   groves; that is, I bid you farewell.
   [1913 Webster]

         So farewell hope, and with hope, farewell fear.
                                                  --Milton.
   [1913 Webster]

         Fare thee well! and if forever,
         Still forever fare thee well.            --Byron.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The primary accent is sometimes placed on the first
         syllable, especially in poetry.
