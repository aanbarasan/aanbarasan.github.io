      <WordDefinition>footprint n. 1. The floor or desk area taken up by a piece of hardware.
   2. [IBM] The audit trail (if any) left by a crashed program (often in
   plural, `footprints'). See also {toeprint}. 3. "RAM footprint": The
   minimum amount of RAM which an OS or other program takes; this figure
   gives one an idea of how much will be left for other applications. How
   actively this RAM is used is another matter entirely. Recent tendencies
   to featuritis and software bloat can expand the RAM footprint of an OS
   to the point of making it nearly unusable in practice. [This problem is,
   thankfully, limited to operating systems so stupid that they don't do
   virtual memory - ESR]
