      <WordDefinition>FAQ /F-A-Q/ or /fak/ n. [Usenet] 1. A Frequently Asked Question. 2. A
   compendium of accumulated lore, posted periodically to high-volume
   newsgroups in an attempt to forestall such questions. Some people prefer
   the term `FAQ list' or `FAQL' /fa'kl/, reserving `FAQ' for sense 1.

   This lexicon itself serves as a good example of a collection of one
   kind of lore, although it is far too big for a regular FAQ posting.
   Examples: "What is the proper type of NULL?" and "What's that funny name
   for the `#' character?" are both Frequently Asked Questions. Several
   FAQs refer readers to this file.
