      <WordDefinition>Flour
   Grain reduced to the form of meal is spoken of in the time of
   Abraham (Gen. 18:6). As baking was a daily necessity, grain was
   also ground daily at the mills (Jer. 25:10). The flour mingled
   with water was kneaded in kneading-troughs, and sometimes leaven
   (Ex. 12:34) was added and sometimes omitted (Gen. 19:3). The
   dough was then formed into thin cakes nine or ten inches in
   diameter and baked in the oven.
   
     Fine flour was offered by the poor as a sin-offering (Lev.
   5:11-13), and also in connection with other sacrifices (Num.
   15:3-12; 28:7-29).
