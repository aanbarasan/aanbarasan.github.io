      <WordDefinition>Farm
   (Matt. 22:5). Every Hebrew had a certain portion of land
   assigned to him as a possession (Num. 26:33-56). In Egypt the
   lands all belonged to the king, and the husbandmen were obliged
   to give him a fifth part of the produce; so in Palestine Jehovah
   was the sole possessor of the soil, and the people held it by
   direct tenure from him. By the enactment of Moses, the Hebrews
   paid a tithe of the produce to Jehovah, which was assigned to
   the priesthood. Military service when required was also to be
   rendered by every Hebrew at his own expense. The occuptaion of a
   husbandman was held in high honour (1 Sam. 11:5-7; 1 Kings
   19:19; 2 Chr. 26:10). (See LAND LAWS ï¿½(n/a); {TITHE}.)
