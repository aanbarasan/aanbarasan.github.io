   Syn: {Fine}, {Beautiful}.

   Usage: When used as a word of praise, fine (being opposed to
          coarse) denotes no ``ordinary thing of its kind.'' It
          is not as strong as beautiful, in reference to the
          single attribute implied in the latter term; but when
          we speak of a fine woman, we include a greater variety
          of particulars, viz., all the qualities which become a
          woman, -- breeding, sentiment, tact, etc. The term is
          equally comprehensive when we speak of a fine garden,
          landscape, horse, poem, etc.; and, though applied to a
          great variety of objects, the word has still a very
          definite sense, denoting a high degree of
          characteristic excellence.
