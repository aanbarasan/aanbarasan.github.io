   1. Because; by reason that; for that; indicating, in Old
      English, the reason of anything.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Since; because; introducing a reason of something before
      advanced, a cause, motive, explanation, justification, or
      the like, of an action related or a statement made. It is
      logically nearly equivalent to since, or because, but
      connects less closely, and is sometimes used as a very
      general introduction to something suggested by what has
      gone before.
      [1913 Webster]

            Give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for his
            mercy endureth forever.               --Ps. cxxxvi.
                                                  1.
      [1913 Webster]

            Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
            Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
            Did not go forth of us, 't were all alike
            As if we had them not.                --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   {For because}, because. [Obs.] ``Nor for because they set
      less store by their own citizens.'' --Robynson (More's
      Utopia).

      (a) Why; for that reason; wherefore. [Obs.]
