      <WordDefinition>flavor n. 1. [common] Variety, type, kind. "DDT commands come in two
   flavors." "These lights come in two flavors, big red ones and small
   green ones." "Linux is a flavor of Unix" See {vanilla}. 2. The attribute
   that causes something to be {flavorful}. Usually used in the phrase
   "yields additional flavor". "This convention yields additional flavor by
   allowing one to print text either right-side-up or upside-down." See
   {vanilla}. This usage was certainly reinforced by the terminology of
   quantum chromodynamics, in which quarks (the constituents of, e.g.,
   protons) come in six flavors (up, down, strange, charm, top, bottom) and
   three colors (red, blue, green) -- however, hackish use of `flavor' at
   MIT predated QCD. 3. The term for `class' (in the object-oriented sense)
   in the LISP Machine Flavors system. Though the Flavors design has been
   superseded (notably by the Common LISP CLOS facility), the term `flavor'
   is still used as a general synonym for `class' by some LISP hackers.
