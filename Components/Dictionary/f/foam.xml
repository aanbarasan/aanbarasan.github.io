      <WordDefinition>Foam
   (Hos. 10:7), the rendering of _ketseph_, which properly means
   twigs or splinters (as rendered in the LXX. and marg. R.V.). The
   expression in Hosea may therefore be read, "as a chip on the
   face of the water," denoting the helplessness of the piece of
   wood as compared with the irresistable current.
