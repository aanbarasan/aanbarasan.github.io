      <WordDefinition>Fornication
   in every form of it was sternly condemned by the Mosaic law
   (Lev. 21:9; 19:29; Deut. 22:20, 21, 23-29; 23:18; Ex. 22:16).
   (See {ADULTERY}.)
   
     But this word is more frequently used in a symbolical than in
   its ordinary sense. It frequently means a forsaking of God or a
   following after idols (Isa. 1:2; Jer. 2:20; Ezek. 16; Hos. 1:2;
   2:1-5; Jer. 3:8,9).

      <WordDefinition>Fornication \For`ni*ca"tion\, n. [F. fornication, L.
   fornicatio.]
   1. Unlawful sexual intercourse on the part of an unmarried
      person; the act of such illicit sexual intercourse between
      a man and a woman as does not by law amount to adultery.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In England, the offense, though cognizable in the
         ecclesiastical courts, was not at common law subject to
         secular prosecution. In the United States it is
         indictable in some States at common law, in others only
         by statute. --Whartyon.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. (Script.)
      (a) Adultery.
      (b) Incest.
      (c) Idolatry.
