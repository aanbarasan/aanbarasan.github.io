      <WordDefinition>filter
     
        1. (Originally {Unix}, now also {MS-DOS}) A program that
        processes an input data stream into an output data stream in
        some well-defined way, and does no I/O to anywhere else except
        possibly on error conditions; one designed to be used as a
        stage in a {pipeline} (see {plumbing}).  Compare {sponge}.
     
        2. ({functional programming}) A {higher-order function} which
        takes a {predicate} and a list and returns those elements of
        the list for which the predicate is true.  In {Haskell}:
     
        	filter p []     = []
        	filter p (x:xs) = if p x then x : rest else rest
        			  where
        			  rest = filter p xs
     
        See also {filter promotion}.
