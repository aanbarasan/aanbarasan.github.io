   Mention is frequently made of the fords of the Jordan (Josh.
   2:7; Judg. 3:28; 12:5, 6), which must have been very numerous;
   about fifty perhaps. The most notable was that of Bethabara.
   Mention is also made of the ford of the Jabbok (Gen. 32:22), and
   of the fords of Arnon (Isa. 16:2) and of the Euphrates (Jer.
   51:32).
