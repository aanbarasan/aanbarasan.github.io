      <WordDefinition>Fertile \Fer"tile\ (? or ?; 277), a. [L. fertilis, fr. ferre to
   bear, produce: cf. F. fertile. See {Bear} to support.]
   1. Producing fruit or vegetation in abundance; fruitful; able
      to produce abundantly; prolific; fecund; productive; rich;
      inventive; as, fertile land or fields; a fertile mind or
      imagination.
      [1913 Webster]

            Though he in a fertile climate dwell. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Bot.)
      (a) Capable of producing fruit; fruit-bearing; as, fertile
          flowers.
      (b) Containing pollen; -- said of anthers.
          [1913 Webster]

   3. produced in abundance; plenteous; ample.
      [1913 Webster]

            Henceforth, my early care . . .
            Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease
            Of thy full branches.                 --Milton.

   Syn: {Fertile}, {Fruitful}.

   Usage: Fertile implies the inherent power of production;
          fruitful, the act. The prairies of the West are
          fertile by nature, and are turned by cultivation into
          fruitful fields. The same distinction prevails when
          these words are used figuratively. A man of fertile
          genius has by nature great readiness of invention; one
          whose mind is fruitful has resources of thought and a
          readiness of application which enable him to think and
          act effectively.
          [1913 Webster]
