      <WordDefinition>Fish
   called _dag_ by the Hebrews, a word denoting great fecundity
   (Gen. 9:2; Num. 11:22; Jonah 2:1, 10). No fish is mentioned by
   name either in the Old or in the New Testament. Fish abounded in
   the Mediterranean and in the lakes of the Jordan, so that the
   Hebrews were no doubt acquainted with many species. Two of the
   villages on the shores of the Sea of Galilee derived their names
   from their fisheries, Bethsaida (the "house of fish") on the
   east and on the west. There is probably no other sheet of water
   in the world of equal dimensions that contains such a variety
   and profusion of fish. About thirty-seven different kinds have
   been found. Some of the fishes are of a European type, such as
   the roach, the barbel, and the blenny; others are markedly
   African and tropical, such as the eel-like silurus. There was a
   regular fish-market apparently in Jerusalem (2 Chr. 33:14; Neh.
   3:3; 12:39; Zeph. 1:10), as there was a fish-gate which was
   probably contiguous to it.
   
     Sidon is the oldest fishing establishment known in history.
