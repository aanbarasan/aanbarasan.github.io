      <WordDefinition>fried
     
        1. &lt;hardware&gt; Non-working due to hardware failure; burnt out.
        Especially used of hardware brought down by a "power glitch"
        (see {glitch}), {drop-outs}, a short, or some other electrical
        event.  (Sometimes this literally happens to electronic
        circuits!  In particular, resistors can burn out and
        transformers can melt down, emitting noxious smoke - see
        {friode}, {SED} and {LER}.  However, this term is also used
        metaphorically.)  Compare {frotzed}.
     
        2. &lt;jargon&gt; Of people, exhausted.  Said particularly of those
        who continue to work in such a state.  Often used as an
        explanation or excuse.  "Yeah, I know that fix destroyed the
        file system, but I was fried when I put it in."  Especially
        common in conjunction with "brain": "My brain is fried today,
        I'm very short on sleep."
