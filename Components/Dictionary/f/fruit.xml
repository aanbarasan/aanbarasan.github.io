      <WordDefinition>Fruit
   a word as used in Scripture denoting produce in general, whether
   vegetable or animal. The Hebrews divided the fruits of the land
   into three classes:,
   
     (1.) The fruit of the field, "corn-fruit" (Heb. dagan); all
   kinds of grain and pulse.
   
     (2.) The fruit of the vine, "vintage-fruit" (Heb. tirosh);
   grapes, whether moist or dried.
   
     (3.) "Orchard-fruits" (Heb. yitshar), as dates, figs, citrons,
   etc.
   
     Injunctions concerning offerings and tithes were expressed by
   these Hebrew terms alone (Num. 18:12; Deut. 14:23). This word
   "fruit" is also used of children or offspring (Gen. 30:2; Deut.
   7:13; Luke 1:42; Ps. 21:10; 132:11); also of the progeny of
   beasts (Deut. 28:51; Isa. 14:29).
   
     It is used metaphorically in a variety of forms (Ps. 104:13;
   Prov. 1:31; 11:30; 31:16; Isa. 3:10; 10:12; Matt. 3:8; 21:41;
   26:29; Heb. 13:15; Rom. 7:4, 5; 15:28).
   
     The fruits of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22, 23; Eph. 5:9; James 3:17,
   18) are those gracious dispositions and habits which the Spirit
   produces in those in whom he dwells and works.
