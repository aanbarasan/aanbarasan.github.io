      <WordDefinition>Forest
   Heb. ya'ar, meaning a dense wood, from its luxuriance. Thus all
   the great primeval forests of Syria (Eccl. 2:6; Isa. 44:14; Jer.
   5:6; Micah 5:8). The most extensive was the trans-Jordanic
   forest of Ephraim (2 Sam. 18:6, 8; Josh. 17:15, 18), which is
   probably the same as the wood of Ephratah (Ps. 132:6), some part
   of the great forest of Gilead. It was in this forest that
   Absalom was slain by Joab. David withdrew to the forest of
   Hareth in the mountains of Judah to avoid the fury of Saul (1
   Sam. 22:5). We read also of the forest of Bethel (2 Kings 2:23,
   24), and of that which the Israelites passed in their pursuit of
   the Philistines (1 Sam. 14:25), and of the forest of the cedars
   of Lebanon (1 Kings 4:33; 2 Kings 19:23; Hos. 14:5, 6).
   
     "The house of the forest of Lebanon (1 Kings 7:2; 10:17; 2
   Chr. 9:16) was probably Solomon's armoury, and was so called
   because the wood of its many pillars came from Lebanon, and they
   had the appearance of a forest. (See {BAALBEC}.)
   
     Heb. horesh, denoting a thicket of trees, underwood, jungle,
   bushes, or trees entangled, and therefore affording a safe
   hiding-place. place. This word is rendered "forest" only in 2
   Chr. 27:4. It is also rendered "wood", the "wood" in the
   "wilderness of Ziph," in which david concealed himself (1 Sam.
   23:15), which lay south-east of Hebron. In Isa. 17:19 this word
   is in Authorized Version rendered incorrectly "bough."
   
     Heb. pardes, meaning an enclosed garden or plantation. Asaph
   is (Neh. 2:8) called the "keeper of the king's forest." The same
   Hebrew word is used Eccl. 2:5, where it is rendered in the
   plural "orchards" (R.V., "parks"), and Cant. 4: 13, rendered
   "orchard" (R.V. marg., "a paradise").
   
     "The forest of the vintage" (Zech. 11:2, "inaccessible
   forest," or R.V. "strong forest") is probably a figurative
   allusion to Jerusalem, or the verse may simply point to the
   devastation of the region referred to.
   
     The forest is an image of unfruitfulness as contrasted with a
   cultivated field (Isa. 29:17; 32:15; Jer. 26:18; Hos. 2:12).
   Isaiah (10:19, 33, 34) likens the Assyrian host under
   Sennacherib (q.v.) to the trees of some huge forest, to be
   suddenly cut down by an unseen stroke.
