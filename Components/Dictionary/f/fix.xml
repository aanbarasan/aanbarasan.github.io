      <WordDefinition>fix
     
        1. &lt;mathematics&gt; The {fixed point} {combinator}.  Called Y in
        {combinatory logic}.  Fix is a {higher-order function} which
        returns a fixed point of its argument (which is a function).
     
        	fix :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a
        	fix f = f (fix f)
     
        Which satisfies the equation
     
        	fix f = x such that f x = x.
     
        Somewhat surprisingly, fix can be defined as the non-recursive
        {lambda abstraction}:
     
        	fix = \ h . (\ x . h (x x)) (\ x . h (x x))
     
        Since this involves self-application, it has an {infinite
        type}.  A function defined by
     
        	f x1 .. xN = E
     
        can be expressed as
     
        	f = fix (\ f . \ x1 ... \ xN . E)
        	  = (\ f . \ x1 ... \xN . E)
        		(fix (\ f . \ x1 ... \ xN . E))
        	  = let f = (fix (\ f . \ x1 ... \ xN . E))
        	    in \ x1 ... \xN . E
     
        If f does not occur {free} in E (i.e. it is not {recursive})
        then this reduces to simply
     
        	f = \ x1 ... \ xN . E
     
        In the case where N = 0 and f is free in E, this defines an
        infinite data object, e.g.
     
        	ones = fix (\ ones . 1 : ones)
        	     = (\ ones . 1 : ones) (fix (\ ones . 1 : ones))
        	     = 1 : (fix (\ ones . 1 : ones))
        	     = 1 : 1 : ...
     
        Fix f is also sometimes written as mu f where mu is the Greek
        letter or alternatively, if f = \ x . E, written as mu x . E.
     
        Compare {quine}.
