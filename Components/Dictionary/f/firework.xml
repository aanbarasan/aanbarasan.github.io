      <WordDefinition>firework \fire"work`\ (f[imac]r"w[^u]rk`), n.
   1. A device for producing a striking display of light, or a
      figure or figures in plain or colored fire, by the
      combustion of materials that burn in some peculiar manner,
      as gunpowder, sulphur, metallic filings, and various
      salts; also called a {pyrotechnic device}. The most common
      feature of fireworks is a paper or pasteboard tube filled
      with the combustible material. A number of these tubes or
      cases are often combined so as to make, when kindled, a
      great variety of figures in fire, often variously colored.
      The skyrocket is a common form of firework. The art of
      designing fireworks for purposes of entertainment is
      called {pyrotechnics}. The name firework is also given to
      various combustible preparations used in war.

   2. pl. A pyrotechnic exhibition; an entertainment consisting
      of the discharge of fireworks[1]. [Obs. in the sing.]
      [1913 Webster +PJC]

            Night before last, the Duke of Richmond gave a
            firework.                             --Walpole.
      [1913 Webster]
