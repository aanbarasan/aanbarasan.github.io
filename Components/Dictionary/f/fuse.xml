      <WordDefinition>Fuse \Fuse\, n. [For fusee, fusil. See 2d {Fusil}.] (Gunnery,
   Mining, etc.)
   1. A tube or casing filled with combustible matter, by means
      of which a charge of powder is ignited, as in blasting; --

   {Fuse hole}, the hole in a shell prepared for the reception
      of the fuse. --Farrow.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Mil.) a mechanism in a bomb, torpedo, rocket, or
      artillery shell, usually having an easily detonated
      explosive charge and activated by the shock of impact,
      which detonates the main explosive charge. Some fuses may
      have timing mechanisms, delaying the explosion for a short
      time, or up to several days after impact. Fuses activated
      by other mechanisms more sophisticated than impact, such
      as proximity or heat, are used in modern weapons such as
      antiaircraft or antimissile missiles.

      <WordDefinition>Fuse \Fuse\, or Fuze \Fuze\, n. (Elec.)
   A wire, bar, or strip of fusible metal inserted for safety in
   an electric circuit. When the current increases beyond a
   certain safe strength, the metal melts, interrupting the
   circuit and thereby preventing possibility of damage. It
   serves the same function as a {circuit breaker}.
