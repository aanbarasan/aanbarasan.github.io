      <WordDefinition>SEX
     
        /seks/ [Sun Users' Group &amp; elsewhere] 1. Software EXchange.  A
        technique invented by the blue-green algae hundreds of
        millions of years ago to speed up their evolution, which had
        been terribly slow up until then.  Today, SEX parties are
        popular among hackers and others (of course, these are no
        longer limited to exchanges of genetic software).  In general,
        SEX parties are a {Good Thing}, but unprotected SEX can
        propagate a {virus}.  See also {pubic directory}.
     
        2. The {mnemonic} often used for Sign EXtend, a machine
        instruction found in the {PDP-11} and many other
        architectures.  The {RCA 1802} chip used in the early {Elf}
        and SuperElf {personal computers} had a "SEt X register" SEX
        instruction, but this seems to have had little folkloric
        impact.
     
        DEC's engineers nearly got a {PDP-11} {assembler} that used
        the "SEX" mnemonic out the door at one time, but (for once)
        marketing wasn't asleep and forced a change.  That wasn't the
        last time this happened, either.  The author of "The Intel
        8086 Primer", who was one of the original designers of the
        {Intel 8086}, noted that there was originally a "SEX"
        instruction on that processor, too.  He says that Intel
        management got cold feet and decreed that it be changed, and
        thus the instruction was renamed "CBW" and "CWD" (depending on
        what was being extended).  The {Intel 8048} (the
        {microcontroller} used in {IBM PC} keyboards) is also missing
        straight "SEX" but has logical-or and logical-and instructions
        "ORL" and "ANL".
     
        The {Motorola 6809}, used in the UK's "{Dragon 32}" {personal
        computer}, actually had an official "SEX" instruction; the
        {6502} in the {Apple II} with which it competed did not.
        British hackers thought this made perfect mythic sense; after
        all, it was commonly observed, you could (on some theoretical
        level) have sex with a dragon, but you can't have sex with an
        apple.

      <WordDefinition>Gender \Gen"der\ (j[e^]n"d[~e]r), n. [OF. genre, gendre (with
   excrescent d.), F.genre, fr. L. genus, generis, birth,
   descent, race, kind, gender, fr. the root of genere, gignere,
   to beget, in pass., to be born, akin to E. kin. See {Kin},
   and cf. {Generate}, {Genre}, {Gentle}, {Genus}.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. Kind; sort. [Obs.] ``One gender of herbs.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Sex, male or female.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The use of the term gender to refer to the sex of an
         animal, especially a person, was once common, then fell
         into disuse as the term became used primarily for the
         distinction of grammatical declension forms in
         inflected words. In the late 1900's, the term again
         became used to refer to the sex of people, as a
         euphemism for the term {sex}, especially in discussions
         of laws and policies on equal treatment of sexes.
         Objections by prescriptivists that the term should be
         used only in a grammatical context ignored the earlier
         uses.
         [PJC]

   3. (Gram.) A classification of nouns, primarily according to
      sex; and secondarily according to some fancied or imputed
      quality associated with sex.
      [1913 Webster]

            Gender is a grammatical distinction and applies to
            words only. Sex is natural distinction and applies
            to living objects.                    --R. Morris.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Adjectives and pronouns are said to vary in gender when
         the form is varied according to the gender of the words
         to which they refer.

   1. The distinguishing peculiarity of male or female in both
      animals and plants; the physical difference between male
      and female; the assemblage of properties or qualities by
      which male is distinguished from female.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. One of the two divisions of organic beings formed on the
      distinction of male and female.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. (Bot.)
      (a) The capability in plants of fertilizing or of being
          fertilized; as, staminate and pistillate flowers are
          of opposite sexes.
      (b) One of the groups founded on this distinction.
          [1913 Webster]

   {The sex}, the female sex; women, in general.
