      <WordDefinition>Skate \Skate\, n. [Icel. skata; cf. Prov. G. schatten,
   meer-schatten, L. squatus, squatina, and E. shad.] (Zo["o]l.)
   Any one of numerous species of large, flat elasmobranch
   fishes of the genus {Raia}, having a long, slender tail,
   terminated by a small caudal fin. The pectoral fins, which
   are large and broad and united to the sides of the body and
   head, give a somewhat rhombic form to these fishes. The skin
   is more or less spinose.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Some of the species are used for food, as the European
         blue or gray skate ({Raia batis}), which sometimes
         weighs nearly 200 pounds. The American smooth, or
         barn-door, skate ({R. l[ae]vis}) is also a large
         species, often becoming three or four feet across. The
         common spiny skate ({R. erinacea}) is much smaller.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Skate's egg}. See {Sea purse}.

   {Skate sucker}, any marine leech of the genus {Pontobdella},
      parasitic on skates.

   A metallic runner with a frame shaped to fit the sole of a
   shoe, -- made to be fastened under the foot, and used for
   moving rapidly on ice.
   [1913 Webster]

         Batavia rushes forth; and as they sweep,
         On sounding skates, a thousand different ways,
         In circling poise, swift as the winds, along,
         The then gay land is maddened all to joy. --Thomson.
   [1913 Webster]

   {Roller skate}. See under {Roller}.
