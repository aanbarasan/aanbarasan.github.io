      <WordDefinition>support
     
        After-sale handholding; something many software vendors
        promise but few deliver.  To hackers, most support people are
        useless - because by the time a hacker calls support he or she
        will usually know the software and the relevant manuals better
        than the support people (sadly, this is *not* a joke or
        exaggeration).  A hacker's idea of "support" is a t�te-�-t�te
        or exchange of {electronic mail} with the software's designer.
