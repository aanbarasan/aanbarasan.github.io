      <WordDefinition>set
     
        A collection of objects, known as the elements of the set,
        specified in such a way that we can tell in principle whether
        or not a given object belongs to it.  E.g. the set of all prime
        numbers, the set of zeros of the cosine function.
     
        For each set there is a {predicate} (or property) which is
        true for (posessed by) exectly those objects which are
        elements of the set.  The predicate may be defined by the set
        or vice versa.  Order and repetition of elements within the
        set are irrelevant so, for example, {1, 2, 3} = {3, 2, 1} =
        {1, 3, 1, 2, 2}.
     
        Some common set of numbers are given the following names:
     
        N = the {natural number}s 0, 1, 2, ...
     
        Z = the {integer}s ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...
     
        Q = the {rational number}s p/q where p, q are in Z and q /= 0.
     
        R = the {real number}s
     
        C = the {complex number}s.
     
        The empty set is the set with no elements.  The intersection
        of two sets X and Y is the set containing all the elements x
        such that x is in X and x is in Y.  The union of two sets is
        the set containing all the elements x such that x is in X or x
        is in Y.
     
        See also {set complement}.
