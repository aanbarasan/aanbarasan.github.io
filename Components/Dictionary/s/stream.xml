      <WordDefinition>stream
     
        1. &lt;communications&gt; An {abstraction} referring to any flow of
        data from a source (or sender, producer) to a single sink (or
        receiver, consumer).  A stream usually flows through a channel
        of some kind, as opposed to {packet}s which may be addressed
        and routed independently, possibly to multiple recipients.
        Streams usually require some mechanism for establishing a
        channel or a "{connection}" between the sender and receiver.
     
        2. &lt;programming&gt; In the {C} language's buffered input/ouput
        library functions, a stream is associated with a file or
        device which has been opened using {fopen}.  Characters may be
        read from (written to) a stream without knowing their actual
        source (destination) and buffering is provided transparently
        by the library routines.
     
        3. &lt;operating system&gt; Confusingly, {Sun} have called their
        modular {device driver} mechanism "{STREAMS}".
     
        4. &lt;operating system&gt; In {IBM}'s {AIX} {operating system}, a
        stream is a {full-duplex} processing and data transfer path
        between a driver in {kernel space} and a process in {user
        space}.
     
        [IBM AIX 3.2 Communication Programming Concepts,
        SC23-2206-03].
     
        5. &lt;communications&gt; {streaming}.
     
        6. &lt;programming&gt; {lazy list}.

      from a furnace; a stream of lava from a volcano.

      parts; as, a stream of words; a stream of sand. ``The
      stream of beneficence.'' --Atterbury. ``The stream of

   {Stream ice}, blocks of ice floating in a mass together in
      some definite direction.

   {Stream tin}, particles or masses of tin ore found in
      alluvial ground; -- so called because a stream of water is
      the principal agent used in separating the ore from the
      sand and gravel.

   {Stream works} (Cornish Mining), a place where an alluvial
      deposit of tin ore is worked. --Ure.

   {To float with the stream}, figuratively, to drift with the
      current of opinion, custom, etc., so as not to oppose or

   Syn: Current; flow; rush; tide; course.

   Usage: {Stream}, {Current}. These words are often properly
          interchangeable; but stream is the broader word,
          denoting a prevailing onward course. The stream of the
          Mississippi rolls steadily on to the Gulf of Mexico,
          but there are reflex currents in it which run for a
          while in a contrary direction.
