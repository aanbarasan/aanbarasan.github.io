      <WordDefinition>Simon
   the abbreviated form of Simeon. (1.) One of the twelve apostles,
   called the Canaanite (Matt. 10:4; Mark 3:18). This word
   "Canaanite" does not mean a native of Canaan, but is derived
   from the Syriac word Kanean or Kaneniah, which was the name of a
   Jewish sect. The Revised Version has "Cananaean;" marg., "or
   Zealot" He is also called "Zelotes" (Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13; R.V.,
   "the Zealot"), because previous to his call to the apostleship
   he had been a member of the fanatical sect of the Zealots. There
   is no record regarding him.
   
     (2.) The father of Judas Iscariot (John 6:71; 13:2, 26).
   
     (3.) One of the brothers of our Lord (Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3).
   
     (4.) A Pharisee in whose house "a woman of the city which was
   a sinner" anointed our Lord's feet with ointment (Luke 7:36-38).
   
     (5.) A leper of Bethany, in whose house Mary anointed our
   Lord's head with ointment "as he sat at meat" (Matt. 26:6-13;
   Mark 14:3-9).
   
     (6.) A Jew of Cyrene, in North Africa, then a province of
   Libya. A hundred thousand Jews from Palestine had been settled
   in this province by Ptolemy Soter (B.C. 323-285), where by this
   time they had greatly increased in number. They had a synagogue
   in Jerusalem for such of their number as went thither to the
   annual feasts. Simon was seized by the soldiers as the
   procession wended its way to the place of crucifixion as he was
   passing by, and the heavy cross which Christ from failing
   strength could no longer bear was laid on his shoulders. Perhaps
   they seized him because he showed sympathy with Jesus. He was
   the "father of Alexander and Rufus" (Matt. 27:32). Possibly this
   Simon may have been one of the "men of Cyrene" who preached the
   word to the Greeks (Acts 11:20).
   
     (7.) A sorcerer of great repute for his magical arts among the
   Samaritans (Acts 8:9-11). He afterwards became a professed
   convert to the faith under the preaching of Philip the deacon
   and evangelist (12, 13). His profession was, however, soon found
   to be hollow. His conduct called forth from Peter a stern rebuke
   (8:18-23). From this moment he disappears from the Church's
   history. The term "Simony," as denoting the purchase for money
   of spiritual offices, is derived from him.
   
     (8.) A Christian at Joppa, a tanner by trade, with whom Peter
   on one occasion lodged (Acts 9:43).
   
     (9.) Simon Peter (Matt. 4:18). See {PETER}.
