      <WordDefinition>Stephen
   one of the seven deacons, who became a preacher of the gospel.
   He was the first Christian martyr. His personal character and
   history are recorded in Acts 6. "He fell asleep" with a prayer
   for his persecutors on his lips (7:60). Devout men carried him
   to his grave (8:2).
   
     It was at the feet of the young Pharisee, Saul of Tarsus, that
   those who stoned him laid their clothes (comp. Deut. 17:5-7)
   before they began their cruel work. The scene which Saul then
   witnessed and the words he heard appear to have made a deep and
   lasting impression on his mind (Acts 22:19, 20).
   
     The speech of Stephen before the Jewish ruler is the first
   apology for the universalism of the gospel as a message to the
   Gentiles as well as the Jews. It is the longest speech contained
   in the Acts, a place of prominence being given to it as a
   defence.
