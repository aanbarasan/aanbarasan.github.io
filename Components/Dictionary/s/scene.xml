   3. So much of a play as passes without change of locality or
      time, or important change of character; hence, a

      subordinate to the act, but differently determined in
      different plays; as, an act of four scenes.
      [1913 Webster]

      or action. ``In Troy, there lies the scene.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

      series of actions and events exhibited in their
      connection; a spectacle; a show; an exhibition; a view.

   6. A landscape, or part of a landscape; scenery.
      [1913 Webster]

            A sylvan scene with various greens was drawn,
            Shades on the sides, and in the midst a lawn.
                                                  --Dryden.

   7. An exhibition of passionate or strong feeling before
      others; often, an artifical or affected action, or course
      of action, done for effect; a theatrical display.
      [1913 Webster]

            Probably no lover of scenes would have had very long
            to wait for some explosions between parties, both
            equally ready to take offense, and careless of
            giving it.                            --De Quincey.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Behind the scenes}, behind the scenery of a theater; out of
      the view of the audience, but in sight of the actors,
      machinery, etc.; hence, conversant with the hidden motives
      and agencies of what appears to public view.
      [1913 Webster]
