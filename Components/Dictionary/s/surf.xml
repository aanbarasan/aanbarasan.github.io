      <WordDefinition>surf v. [from the `surf' idiom for rapidly flipping TV channels] To
   traverse the Internet in search of interesting stuff, used esp. if one
   is doing so with a World Wide Web browser. It is also common to speak of
   `surfing in' to a particular resource.

   Hackers adopted this term early, but many have stopped using it since
   it went completely mainstream around 1995. The passive, couch-potato
   connotations that go with TV channel surfing were never pleasant, and
   hearing non-hackers wax enthusiastic about "surfing the net" tends to
   make hackers feel a bit as though their home is being overrun by
   ignorami.
