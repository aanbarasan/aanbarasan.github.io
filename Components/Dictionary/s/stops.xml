         and king and queen and jack of separate suits (taken from
         a separate deck); a player plays the lowest card of a
         suit in his hand and successively higher cards are played
         until the sequence stops; the player who plays a card

         card [syn: {Michigan}, {Chicago}, {Newmarket}, {boodle}]
