      <WordDefinition>Sarah
   princess, the wife and at the same time the half-sister of
   Abraham (Gen. 11:29; 20:12). This name was given to her at the
   time that it was announced to Abraham that she should be the
   mother of the promised child. Her story is from her marriage
   identified with that of the patriarch till the time of her
   death. Her death, at the age of one hundred and twenty-seven
   years (the only instance in Scripture where the age of a woman
   is recorded), was the occasion of Abraham's purchasing the cave
   of Machpelah as a family burying-place.
   
     In the allegory of Gal. 4:22-31 she is the type of the
   "Jerusalem which is above." She is also mentioned as Sara in
   Heb. 11:11 among the Old Testament worthies, who "all died in
   faith." (See {ABRAHAM}.)
