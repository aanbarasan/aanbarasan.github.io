      <WordDefinition>Shall \Shall\, v. i. &amp; auxiliary. [imp. {Should}.] [OE. shal,
   schal, imp. sholde, scholde, AS. scal, sceal, I am obliged,
   imp. scolde, sceolde, inf. sculan; akin to OS. skulan, pres.
   skal, imp. skolda, D. zullen, pres. zal, imp. zoude, zou,
   OHG. solan, scolan, pres. scal, sol. imp. scolta, solta, G.
   sollen, pres. soll, imp. sollte, Icel. skulu, pres. skal,
   imp. skyldi, SW. skola, pres. skall, imp. skulle, Dan.
   skulle, pres. skal, imp. skulde, Goth. skulan, pres. skal,
   imp. skulda, and to AS. scyld guilt, G. schuld guilt, fault,
   debt, and perhaps to L. scelus crime.]

   Note: [Shall is defective, having no infinitive, imperative,
         or participle.]
   1. To owe; to be under obligation for. [Obs.] ``By the faith
      I shall to God'' --Court of Love.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. To be obliged; must. [Obs.] ``Me athinketh [I am sorry]
      that I shall rehearse it her.'' --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. As an auxiliary, shall indicates a duty or necessity whose
      obligation is derived from the person speaking; as, you
      shall go; he shall go; that is, I order or promise your
      going. It thus ordinarily expresses, in the second and
      third persons, a command, a threat, or a promise. If the
      auxillary be emphasized, the command is made more
      imperative, the promise or that more positive and sure. It
      is also employed in the language of prophecy; as, ``the
      day shall come when . . ., '' since a promise or threat
      and an authoritative prophecy nearly coincide in
      significance. In shall with the first person, the
      necessity of the action is sometimes implied as residing
      elsewhere than in the speaker; as, I shall suffer; we
      shall see; and there is always a less distinct and
      positive assertion of his volition than is indicated by
      will. ``I shall go'' implies nearly a simple futurity;
      more exactly, a foretelling or an expectation of my going,
      in which, naturally enough, a certain degree of plan or
      intention may be included; emphasize the shall, and the
      event is described as certain to occur, and the expression
      approximates in meaning to our emphatic ``I will go.'' In
      a question, the relation of speaker and source of
      obligation is of course transferred to the person
      addressed; as, ``Shall you go?'' (answer, ``I shall go'');
      ``Shall he go?'' i. e., ``Do you require or promise his
      going?'' (answer, ``He shall go''.) The same relation is
      transferred to either second or third person in such
      phrases as ``You say, or think, you shall go;'' ``He says,
      or thinks, he shall go.'' After a conditional conjunction
      (as if, whether) shall is used in all persons to express
      futurity simply; as, if I, you, or he shall say they are
      right. Should is everywhere used in the same connection
      and the same senses as shall, as its imperfect. It also
      expresses duty or moral obligation; as, he should do it
      whether he will or not. In the early English, and hence in
      our English Bible, shall is the auxiliary mainly used, in
      all the persons, to express simple futurity. (Cf. {Will},
      v. t.) Shall may be used elliptically; thus, with an
      adverb or other word expressive of motion go may be
      omitted. ``He to England shall along with you.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Shall and will are often confounded by inaccurate
         speakers and writers. Say: I shall be glad to see you.
         Shall I do this? Shall I help you? (not Will I do
         this?) See {Will}.
         [1913 Webster]

      <WordDefinition>Should \Should\ (sh[oo^]d), imp. of {Shall}. [OE. sholde,
   shulde, scholde, schulde, AS. scolde, sceolde. See {Shall}.]
   Used as an auxiliary verb, to express a conditional or
   contingent act or state, or as a supposition of an actual
   fact; also, to express moral obligation (see {Shall}); e. g.:
   they should have come last week; if I should go; I should
   think you could go. ``You have done that you should be sorry
   for.'' --Shak.
   [1913 Webster]

   Syn: See {Ought}.
