        &lt;jargon&gt; /smerf/ (From the {news:soc.motss} {Usenet}
        newsgroup, after some obnoxiously gooey cartoon characters) A
        newsgroup regular with a habitual style that is irreverent,
        silly, and cute.  Like many other hackish terms for people,
        this one may be praise or insult depending on who uses it.  In
        general, being referred to as a smurf is probably not going to
        make your day unless you've previously adopted the label
        yourself in a spirit of irony.
     
        Compare {old fart}.

      <WordDefinition>smurf /smerf/ n. 1. [from the soc.motss newsgroup on Usenet, after some
   obnoxiously gooey cartoon characters] A newsgroup regular with a
   habitual style that is irreverent, silly, and cute. Like many other
   hackish terms for people, this one may be praise or insult depending on
   who uses it. In general, being referred to as a smurf is probably not
   going to make your day unless you've previously adopted the label
   yourself in a spirit of irony. Compare {old fart}. 2. [techspeak] A ping
   packet with a forged source address sent to some other network's
   broadcast address. All the machines on the destination network will send
   a ping response to the forged source address (the victim). This both
   overloads the victim's network and hides the location of the attacker.
