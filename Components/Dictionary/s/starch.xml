      <WordDefinition>Starch \Starch\, n. [From starch stiff, cf. G. st["a]rke, fr.
   stark strong.]
   1. (Chem.) A widely diffused vegetable substance found
      especially in seeds, bulbs, and tubers, and extracted (as
      from potatoes, corn, rice, etc.) as a white, glistening,
      granular or powdery substance, without taste or smell, and
      giving a very peculiar creaking sound when rubbed between
      the fingers. It is used as a food, in the production of
      commercial grape sugar, for stiffening linen in laundries,
      in making paste, etc.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Starch is a carbohydrate, being the typical amylose,
         {C6H10O5}, and is detected by the fine blue color given
         to it by free iodine. It is not fermentable as such,
         but is changed by diastase into dextrin and maltose,
         and by heating with dilute acids into dextrose. Cf.
         {Sugar}, {Inulin}, and {Lichenin}.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. Fig.: A stiff, formal manner; formality. --Addison.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Starch hyacinth} (Bot.), the grape hyacinth; -- so called
      because the flowers have the smell of boiled starch. See
      under {Grape}.
