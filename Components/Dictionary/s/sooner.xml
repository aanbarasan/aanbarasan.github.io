      <WordDefinition>Sooner \Soon"er\, n.
   In the western United States, one who settles on government
   land before it is legally open to settlement in order to gain
   the prior claim that the law gives to the first settler when
   the land is opened to settlement; hence, any one who does a
   thing prematurely or anticipates another in acting in order
   to gain an unfair advantage.
   [Webster 1913 Suppl.]
