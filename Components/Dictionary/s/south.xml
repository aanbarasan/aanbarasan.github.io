      <WordDefinition>South
   Heb. Negeb, that arid district to the south of Palestine through
   which lay the caravan route from Central Palestine to Egypt
   (Gen. 12:9; 13:1, 3; 46:1-6). "The Negeb comprised a
   considerable but irregularly-shaped tract of country, its main
   portion stretching from the mountains and lowlands of Judah in
   the north to the mountains of Azazemeh in the south, and from
   the Dead Sea and southern Ghoron the east to the Mediterranean
   on the west." In Ezek. 20:46 (21:1 in Heb.) three different
   Hebrew words are all rendered "south." (1) "Set thy face toward
   the south" (Teman, the region on the right, 1 Sam. 33:24); (2)
   "Drop thy word toward the south" (Negeb, the region of dryness,
   Josh. 15:4); (3) "Prophesy against the forest of the south
   field" (Darom, the region of brightness, Deut. 33:23). In Job
   37:9 the word "south" is literally "chamber," used here in the
   sense of treasury (comp. 38:22; Ps. 135:7). This verse is
   rendered in the Revised Version "out of the chamber of the
   south."
