      <WordDefinition>Snow
   Common in Palestine in winter (Ps. 147:16). The snow on the tops
   of the Lebanon range is almost always within view throughout the
   whole year. The word is frequently used figuratively by the
   sacred writers (Job 24:19; Ps. 51:7; 68:14; Isa. 1:18). It is
   mentioned only once in the historical books (2 Sam. 23:20). It
   was "carried to Tyre, Sidon, and Damascus as a luxury, and
   labourers sweltering in the hot harvest-fields used it for the
   purpose of cooling the water which they drank (Prov. 25:13; Jer.
   18:14). No doubt Herod Antipas, at his feasts in Tiberias,
   enjoyed also from this very source the modern luxury of
   ice-water."
