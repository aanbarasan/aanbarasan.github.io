          division.
          [1913 Webster]

                It is hardly possible to give a distinct view of

      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In mechanical drawing, as in these Illustrations of a
         cannon, a longitudinal section (a) usually represents
         the object as cut through its center lengthwise and
         vertically; a cross or transverse section (b), as cut
         crosswise and vertically; and a horizontal section (c),
         as cut through its center horizontally. Oblique
         sections are made at various angles. In architecture, a
         vertical section is a drawing showing the interior, the
         thickness of the walls, etc., as if made on a vertical
         plane passed through a building.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Angular sections} (Math.), a branch of analysis which treats
      of the relations of sines, tangents, etc., of arcs to the
      sines, tangents, etc., of their multiples or of their
      parts. [R.]

   {Conic sections}. (Geom.) See under {Conic}.

   {Section liner} (Drawing), an instrument to aid in drawing a
      series of equidistant parallel lines, -- used in
      representing sections.

   {Thin section}, a section or slice, as of mineral, animal, or
      vegetable substance, thin enough to be transparent, and
      used for study under the microscope.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Part; portion; division.

   Usage: {Section}, {Part}. The English more commonly apply the
          word section to a part or portion of a body of men;
          as, a section of the clergy, a small section of the
          Whigs, etc. In the United States this use is less
          common, but another use, unknown or but little known
          in England, is very frequent, as in the phrases ``the
          eastern section of our country,'' etc., the same sense
          being also given to the adjective sectional; as,
          sectional feelings, interests, etc.
          [1913 Webster]
