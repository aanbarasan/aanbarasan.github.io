      <WordDefinition>SYMBOLIC, adj.  Pertaining to symbols and the use and interpretation
of symbols.

    They say 'tis conscience feels compunction;
    I hold that that's the stomach's function,
    For of the sinner I have noted
    That when he's sinned he's somewhat bloated,
    Or ill some other ghastly fashion
    Within that bowel of compassion.
    True, I believe the only sinner
    Is he that eats a shabby dinner.
    You know how Adam with good reason,
    For eating apples out of season,
    Was "cursed."  But that is all symbolic:
    The truth is, Adam had the colic.

                                  T


T, the twentieth letter of the English alphabet, was by the Greeks
absurdly called _tau_.  In the alphabet whence ours comes it had the
form of the rude corkscrew of the period, and when it stood alone
(which was more than the Phoenicians could always do) signified
_Tallegal_, translated by the learned Dr. Brownrigg, "tanglefoot."
