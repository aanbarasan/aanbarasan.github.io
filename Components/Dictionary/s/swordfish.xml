   1. (Zo["o]l.)

          only representative of the family {Xiphiid[ae]}. It is

          swordlike beak; the dorsal fin is high and without
          distinct spines; the ventral fins are absent. The
          adult is destitute of teeth. It becomes sixteen feet
          or more long.
      (b) The gar pike.
      (c) The cutlass fish.
