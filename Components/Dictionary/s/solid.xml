   Syn: Hard; firm; compact; strong; substantial; stable; sound;
        real; valid; true; just; weighty; profound; grave;
        important.

   Usage: {Solid}, {Hard}. These words both relate to the
          internal constitution of bodies; but hardnotes a more
          impenetrable nature or a firmer adherence of the
          component parts than solid. Hard is opposed to soft,
          and solid to fluid, liquid, open, or hollow. Wood is
          usually solid; but some kinds of wood are hard, and
          others are soft.
          [1913 Webster]

                raised.                           --Shak.
          [1913 Webster]

                I hear his thundering voice resound,
                And trampling feet than shake the solid ground.
                                                  --Dryden.
          [1913 Webster]
