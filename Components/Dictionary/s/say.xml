        A human may "say" things to a computer by typing them on a
        terminal.  "To list a directory verbosely, say "ls -l"."
        Tends to imply a {newline}-terminated command (a "sentence").
     
        A computer may "say" things to you, even if it doesn't have a
        speech synthesiser, by displaying them on a terminal in
        response to your commands.  This usage often confuses
        {mundane}s.

      <WordDefinition>say vt. 1. To type to a terminal. "To list a directory verbosely, you
   have to say `ls -l'." Tends to imply a {newline}-terminated command (a
   `sentence'). 2. A computer may also be said to `say' things to you, even
   if it doesn't have a speech synthesizer, by displaying them on a
   terminal in response to your commands. Hackers find it odd that this
   usage confuses {mundane}s.
