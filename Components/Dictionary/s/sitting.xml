      <WordDefinition>Sitting
   the attitude generally assumed in Palestine by those who were
   engaged in any kind of work. "The carpenter saws, planes, and
   hews with his hand-adze, sitting on the ground or upon the plank
   he is planning. The washerwoman sits by the tub; and, in a word,
   no one stands when it is possible to sit. Shopkeepers always
   sit, and Levi sitting at the receipt of custom (Matt. 9:9) is
   the exact way to state the case.", Thomson, Land and Book.
