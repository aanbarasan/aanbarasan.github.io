      <WordDefinition>Squirrel \Squir"rel\ (skw[~e]r"r[e^]l or skw[i^]r"-; 277), n.

   1. (Zo["o]l.) Any one of numerous species of small rodents
      belonging to the genus {Sciurus} and several allied genera
      of the family {Sciurid[ae]}. Squirrels generally have a
      bushy tail, large erect ears, and strong hind legs. They
      are commonly arboreal in their habits, but many species
      live in burrows.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Among the common North American squirrels are the gray
         squirrel ({Sciurus Carolinensis}) and its black
         variety; the fox, or cat, squirrel ({Sciurus cinereus},
         or {Sciurus niger}) which is a large species, and
         variable in color, the southern variety being
         frequently black, while the northern and western
         varieties are usually gray or rusty brown; the red
         squirrel (see {Chickaree}); the striped, or chipping,
         squirrel (see {Chipmunk}); and the California gray
         squirrel ({Sciurus fossor}). Several other species
         inhabit Mexico and Central America. The common European
         species ({Sciurus vulgaris}) has a long tuft of hair on
         each ear. The so-called Australian squirrels are
         marsupials. See {Petaurist}, and {Phalanger}.
