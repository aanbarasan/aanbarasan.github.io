      <WordDefinition>silicon
Symbol: Si
Atomic number: 14
Atomic weight: 28.086
Metalloid element belonging to group 14 of the periodic table. It is the
second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, making up 25.7% of it
by weight. Chemically less reactive than carbon. First identified by
Lavoisier in 1787 and first isolated in 1823 by Berzelius.

      <WordDefinition>Silicon \Sil"i*con\, n. [See {Silica}.] (Chem.)
   A nonmetalic element analogous to carbon. It always occurs
   combined in nature, and is artificially obtained in the free
   state, usually as a dark brown amorphous powder, or as a dark
   crystalline substance with a meetallic luster. Its oxide is
   silica, or common quartz, and in this form, or as silicates,
   it is, next to oxygen, the most abundant element of the
   earth's crust. Silicon is characteristically the element of
   the mineral kingdom, as carbon is of the organic world.
   Symbol Si. Atomic weight 28. Called also {silicium}.
