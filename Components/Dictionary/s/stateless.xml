      <WordDefinition>stateless
     
        A stateless {server} is one which treats each request as an
        independent transaction, unrelated to any previous request.
        This simplifies the server design because it does not need to
        allocate storage to deal with conversations in progress or
        worry about freeing it if a client dies in mid-transaction.  A
        disadvantage is that it may be necessary to include more
        information in each request and this extra information will
        need to be interpreted by the server each time.
     
        An example of a stateless server is a {World-Wide Web} server.
        These take in requests ({URL}s) which completely specify the
        required document and do not require any context or memory of
        previous requests.
     
        Contrast this with a traditional {FTP} server which conducts
        an interactive session with the user.  A request to the server
        for a file can assume that the user has been authenticated and
        that the current directory and transfer mode have been set.
