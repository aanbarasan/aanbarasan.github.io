   Introduction Switzerland
   ------------------------
                            Background: Switzerland's independence and
                                        neutrality have long been honored by
                                        the major European powers and
                                        Switzerland was not involved in
                                        either of the two World Wars. The
                                        political and economic integration
                                        of Europe over the past half
                                        century, as well as Switzerland's
                                        role in many UN and international
                                        organizations has strengthened
                                        Switzerland's ties with its
                                        neighbors. Switzerland is active in
                                        many UN and international
                                        organizations, but retains a strong
                                        commitment to neutrality.

   Economy Switzerland
   -------------------
                    Economy - overview: Switzerland is a prosperous and
                                        stable modern market economy with a
                                        per capita GDP higher than that of
                                        the big western European economies.
                                        The Swiss in recent years have
                                        brought their economic practices
                                        largely into conformity with the
                                        EU's to enhance their international
                                        competitiveness. Although the Swiss
                                        are not pursuing full EU membership
                                        in the near term, in 1999 Bern and
                                        Brussels signed agreements to
                                        further liberalize trade ties. They
                                        continue to discuss further areas
                                        for cooperation. Switzerland remains
                                        a safe haven for investors, because
                                        it has maintained a degree of bank
                                        secrecy and has kept up the franc's
                                        long-term external value. The GDP
                                        growth rate dipped to 1.6% in 2001,
                                        and the government projects that it
                                        will slow further to 1.3% in 2002.
