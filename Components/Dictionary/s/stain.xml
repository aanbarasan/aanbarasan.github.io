      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To paint; dye; blot; soil; sully; discolor; disgrace;
        taint.

   Usage: {Paint}, {Stain}, {Dye}. These denote three different
          processes; the first mechanical, the other two,
          chiefly chemical. To paint a thing is to spread a coat
          of coloring matter over it; to stain or dye a thing is
          to impart color to its substance. To stain is said
          chiefly of solids, as wood, glass, paper; to dye, of
          fibrous substances, textile fabrics, etc.; the one,
          commonly, a simple process, as applying a wash; the
          other more complex, as fixing colors by mordants.
          [1913 Webster]
