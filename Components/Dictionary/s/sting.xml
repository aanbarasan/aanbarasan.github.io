   1. (Zo["o]l.) Any sharp organ of offense and defense,
      especially when connected with a poison gland, and adapted

   2. (Bot.) A sharp-pointed hollow hair seated on a gland which
      secrets an acrid fluid, as in nettles. The points of these
      hairs usually break off in the wound, and the acrid fluid
      is pressed into it.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Anything that gives acute pain, bodily or mental; as, the
      stings of remorse; the stings of reproach.

                                                  56.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. The thrust of a sting into the flesh; the act of stinging;
      a wound inflicted by stinging. ``The lurking serpent's
      mortal sting.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. A goad; incitement. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   6. The point of an epigram or other sarcastic saying.
