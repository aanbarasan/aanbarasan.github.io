      <WordDefinition>Seed \Seed\ (s[=e]d), n.; pl. {Seed} or {Seeds}. [OE. seed, sed,
   AS. s[=ae]d, fr. s[=a]wan to sow; akin to D. zaad seed, G.
   saat, Icel. s[=a][eth], s[ae][eth]i, Goth. manas[=e][thorn]s
   seed of men, world. See {Sow} to scatter seed, and cf.
   {Colza}.]
   1. (Bot.)
      (a) A ripened ovule, consisting of an embryo with one or
          more integuments, or coverings; as, an apple seed; a
          currant seed. By germination it produces a new plant.
      (b) Any small seedlike fruit, though it may consist of a
          pericarp, or even a calyx, as well as the seed proper;
          as, parsnip seed; thistle seed.
          [1913 Webster]

                And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass,
                the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree
                yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in
                itself.                           --Gen. i. 11.
          [1913 Webster]

   Note: The seed proper has an outer and an inner coat, and
         within these the kernel or nucleus. The kernel is
         either the embryo alone, or the embryo inclosed in the
         albumen, which is the material for the nourishment of
         the developing embryo. The scar on a seed, left where
         the stem parted from it, is called the hilum, and the
         closed orifice of the ovule, the micropyle.

   5. Progeny; offspring; children; descendants; as, the seed of
      Abraham; the seed of David.

         any number collectively, and admits of the plural form,
         though rarely used in the plural.
         [1913 Webster]

   6. Race; generation; birth.
