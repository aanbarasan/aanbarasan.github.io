      <WordDefinition>Strict \Strict\, a. [Compar. {Stricter}; superl. {Strictest}.]
   [L. strictus, p. p. of stringere to draw or bind tight, to
   strain. See {Strain}, and cf. {Strait}, a.]
   1. Strained; drawn close; tight; as, a strict embrace; a
      strict ligature. --Dryden.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Tense; not relaxed; as, a strict fiber.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Exact; accurate; precise; rigorously nice; as, to keep
      strict watch; to pay strict attention. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            It shall be still in strictest measure. --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. Governed or governing by exact rules; observing exact
      rules; severe; rigorous; as, very strict in observing the
      Sabbath. ``Through the strict senteries.'' --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. Rigidly; interpreted; exactly limited; confined;
      restricted; as, to understand words in a strict sense.
      [1913 Webster]

   6. (Bot.) Upright, or straight and narrow; -- said of the
      shape of the plants or their flower clusters.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Exact; accurate; nice; close; rigorous; severe.

   Usage: {Strict}, {Severe}. Strict, applied to a person,
          denotes that he conforms in his motives and acts to a
          principle or code by which he is bound; severe is
          strict with an implication often, but not always, of
          harshness. Strict is opposed to lax; severe is opposed
          to gentle.
          [1913 Webster]

                And rules as strict his labored work confine,
                As if the Stagirite o'erlooked each line.
                                                  --Pope.
          [1913 Webster]

                Soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve: 
                ``What words have passed thy lips, Adam
                severe!''                         --Milton.
          [1913 Webster]

   {The Strict Observance}, or {Friars of the Strict
   Observance}. (R. C. Ch.) See {Observance}.
      [1913 Webster]
