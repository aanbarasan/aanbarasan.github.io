      <WordDefinition>Sandals
   Mentioned only in Mark 6:9 and Acts 12:8. The sandal was simply
   a sole, made of wood or palm-bark, fastened to the foot by
   leathern straps. Sandals were also made of seal-skin (Ezek.
   16:10; lit. tahash, "leather;" A.V., "badger's skin;" R.V.,
   "sealskin," or marg., "porpoise-skin"). (See {SHOE}.)
