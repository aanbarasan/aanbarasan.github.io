      <WordDefinition>s///
     
        &lt;chat&gt; s/{foo}/{bar}/ is an idiom which means "I didn't mean
        to type 'foo', I meant to type 'bar'".
     
        Its use in {talk} systems, especially {irc}, comes from the
        use of s/// as a substitution operator in {Perl}, {sed} and
        {ed}.  In these languages and tools, s/foo/bar/ would replace
        any substring matching the {regular expression} "foo" with the
        string "bar".

      <WordDefinition>S \S\ ([e^]s),
   the nineteenth letter of the English alphabet, is a
   consonant, and is often called a sibilant, in allusion to its
   hissing sound. It has two principal sounds; one a mere
   hissing, as in sack, this; the other a vocal hissing (the
   same as that of z), as in is, wise. Besides these it
   sometimes has the sounds of sh and zh, as in sure, measure.
   It generally has its hissing sound at the beginning of words,
   but in the middle and at the end of words its sound is
   determined by usage. In a few words it is silent, as in isle,
   d['e]bris. With the letter h it forms the digraph sh. See
   Guide to pronunciation, [sect][sect] 255-261.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Both the form and the name of the letter S are derived
         from the Latin, which got the letter through the Greek
         from the Ph[ae]nician. The ultimate origin is Egyptian.
         S is etymologically most nearly related to c, z, t, and
         r; as, in ice, OE. is; E. hence, OE. hennes; E. rase,
         raze; erase, razor; that, G. das; E. reason, F. raison,
         L. ratio; E. was, were; chair, chaise (see C, Z, T, and
         R.).
