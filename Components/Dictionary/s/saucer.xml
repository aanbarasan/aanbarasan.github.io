      [Obs.] --Bacon.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. A small dish, commonly deeper than a plate, in which a cup
      is set at table.

   3. Something resembling a saucer in shape. Specifically:
      (a) A flat, shallow caisson for raising sunken ships.
      (b) A shallow socket for the pivot of a capstan.
          [1913 Webster]

   {Flying saucer}, a type of Unidentified Flying Object, having
      a biconvex discoid shape; such objects are occasionally
      reported to have been sighted, but no example of one has
      been reliably shown to exist. They are believed by
      ufologists to originate in outer space, but they are
      generally presumed to be misinterpretations of ordinary
      phenomena, illusions or imaginary objects. Fraudulent
      photographs purporting to show flying saucers are
      published from time to time.
