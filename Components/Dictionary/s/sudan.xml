   Introduction Sudan
   ------------------
                            Background: Military dictatorships favoring an
                                        Islamic-oriented government have
                                        dominated national politics since
                                        independence from the UK in 1956.
                                        Sudan has been embroiled in a civil
                                        war for all but 10 years of this
                                        period (1972-82). Since 1983, the
                                        war and war- and famine-related
                                        effects have led to more than 2
                                        million deaths and over 4 million
                                        people displaced. The war pits the
                                        Arab/Muslim majority in Khartoum
                                        against the non-Muslim African
                                        rebels in the south. Since 1989,
                                        traditional northern Muslim parties
                                        have made common cause with the
                                        southern rebels and entered the war
                                        as a part of an anti-government
                                        alliance.

   Economy Sudan
   -------------
                    Economy - overview: Sudan has turned around a struggling
                                        economy with sound economic policies
                                        and infrastructure investments, but
                                        it still faces formidable economic
                                        problems. Starting in 1997 Sudan
                                        began implementing IMF macroeconomic
                                        reforms that have successfully
                                        stabilized inflation. In 1999 Sudan
                                        began exporting crude oil and in the
                                        last quarter of 1999 recorded its
                                        first trade surplus, along with
                                        monetary policy, has stabilized the
                                        exchange rate. Current oil
                                        production stands at 220,000 barrels
                                        per day, of which some 70% is
                                        exported and the rest refined mostly
                                        for domestic consumption. Increased
                                        oil production, revived light
                                        industry, and expanded export
                                        processing zones should maintain GDP
                                        growth at 5% in 2002. Agriculture
                                        production remains Sudan's most
                                        important sector, employing 80% of
                                        the work force and contributing 43%
                                        of GDP, but most farms remain rain-
                                        fed and susceptible to drought.
                                        Sudan is also constrained by its
                                        limited access to international
                                        credit; most of Sudan's $24.9
                                        billion debt remains in arrears. The
                                        civil war, chronic instability,
                                        adverse weather, and weak world
