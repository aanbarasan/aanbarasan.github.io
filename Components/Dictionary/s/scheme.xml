      <WordDefinition>Scheme
     
        &lt;programming&gt; (Originally "Schemer", by analogy with {Planner}
        and {Conniver}).  A small, uniform {Lisp} dialect with clean
        {semantics}, developed initially by {Guy Steele} and {Gerald
        Sussman} in 1975.  Scheme uses {applicative order reduction}
        and {lexical scope}.  It treats both {functions} and
        {continuations} as {first-class} objects.
     
        One of the most used implementations is {DrScheme}, others
        include {Bigloo}, {Elk}, {Liar}, {Orbit}, {Scheme86} (Indiana
        U), {SCM}, {MacScheme} (Semantic Microsystems), {PC Scheme}
        (TI), {MIT Scheme}, and {T}.

        {Schematik}, {Scheme Repository}, {STk}, {syntax-case}, {Tiny
        Clos}, {Paradigms of AI Programming}.
     
        There have been a series of revisions of the report defining
        Scheme, known as {RRS} (Revised Report on Scheme), {R2RS}
        (Revised Revised Report ..), {R3RS}, {R3.899RS}, {R4RS}.

      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Plan; project; contrivance; purpose; device; plot.

   Usage: {Scheme}, {Plan}. Scheme and plan are subordinate to
          design; they propose modes of carrying our designs
          into effect. Scheme is the least definite of the two,
          and lies more in speculation. A plan is drawn out into
          details with a view to being carried into effect. As
          schemes are speculative, they often prove visionary;
          hence the opprobrious use of the words schemer and
          scheming. Plans, being more practical, are more
          frequently carried into effect.
          [1913 Webster]

                He forms the well-concerted scheme of mischief;

                death.                            --Rowe.
          [1913 Webster]

                I founded palaces, and planted bowers. --Prior.
