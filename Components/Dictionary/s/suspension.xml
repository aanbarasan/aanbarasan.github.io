      <WordDefinition>suspension
     
        In {lazy evaluation}, a suspension (or in Henderson's
        terminology, a "recipe") is a {closure} with a flag indicating
        whether the expression has been evaluated or not.  When the
        expression is evaluated the first time, this flag is set.
        Subsequent requests for the value of the expression will not
        attempt to re-evaluate it.
