      <WordDefinition>Sophomore \Soph"o*more\, n. [Probably fr. soph or sophister +
   Gr. ? foolish. The word was probably introduced into the
   United States at an early date, from the University of
   Cambridge, England. Among the cant terms at that university,
   as given in the Gradus ad Cantabrigiam, we find Soph-Mor as
   ``the next distinctive appellation to Freshman,'' but the
   term has now almost ceased to be known at the English
   university from whence it came.]
   One belonging to the second of the four classes in an
   American college, or one next above a freshman. [Formerly
   written also {sophimore}.]
   [1913 Webster]
