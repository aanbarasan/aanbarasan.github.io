   Usage: {Smart}, {Clever}. Smart has been much used in New
          England to describe a person who is intelligent,
          vigorous, and active; as, a smart young fellow; a
          smart workman, etc., conciding very nearly with the
          English sense of clever. The nearest approach to this
          in England is in such expressions as, he was smart
          (pungent or witty) in his reply, etc.; but smart and
          smartness, when applied to persons, more commonly
          refer to dress; as, a smart appearance; a smart gown,
          etc.
