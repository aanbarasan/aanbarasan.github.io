      <WordDefinition>segment
     
        /seg'ment/ 1. &lt;architecture&gt; A collection of {pages} in a
        {memory management} system.
     
        2. &lt;programming&gt; A separately relocatable section of an
        executable program.  {Unix} executables have a {text segment}
        (executable machine instructions), a {data segment}
        (initialised data) and a {bss segment} (uninitialised data).
     
        3. &lt;networking&gt; {network segment}.
     
        4. To experience a {segmentation fault}.  Confusingly, the stress
        is often put on the first syllable, like the noun "segment",
        rather than the second like mainstream verb "segment".  This
        is because it is actually a noun shorthand that has been
        verbed.

      <WordDefinition>segment /seg'ment/ vi. To experience a {segmentation fault}.
   Confusingly, this is often pronounced more like the noun `segment' than
   like mainstream v. segment; this is because it is actually a noun
   shorthand that has been verbed.
