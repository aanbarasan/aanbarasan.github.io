      <WordDefinition>syntax
     
        The structure of strings in some language.  A language's
        syntax is described by a {grammar}.  For example, the syntax
        of a binary number could be expressed as
     
        	binary_number = bit [ binary_number ]
     
        	bit = "0" | "1"
     
        meaning that a binary number is a bit optionally followed by a
        binary number and a bit is a literal zero or one digit.
     
        The meaning of the language is given by its {semantics}.
     
        See also {abstract syntax}, {concrete syntax}.
