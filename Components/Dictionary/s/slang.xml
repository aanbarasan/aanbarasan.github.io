      <WordDefinition>SLANG, n.  The grunt of the human hog (_Pignoramus intolerabilis_)
with an audible memory.  The speech of one who utters with his tongue
what he thinks with his ear, and feels the pride of a creator in
accomplishing the feat of a parrot.  A means (under Providence) of
setting up as a wit without a capital of sense.

        &lt;language&gt; A small but highly functional {embedded}
        {interpreter}.  S-Lang was a stack-based {postfix} language
        resembling {Forth} and {BC}/{DC} with limited support for
        {infix notation}.  Now it has a {C}-like infix syntax.
        {Arrays}, stings, integers, {floating-point} and {autoloading}
        are all suported.  The editor {JED} embeds S-lang.
     
        S-Lang is available under the {GNU Library General Public
        License}.  It runs on {MS-DOS}, {Unix}, and {VMS}.
