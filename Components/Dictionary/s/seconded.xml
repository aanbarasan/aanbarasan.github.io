      [1913 Webster]

            In human works though labored on with pain,
            A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;
            In God's, one single can its end produce,
            Yet serves to second too some other use. --Pope.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Specifically, (Parliamentary Procedure) to support, as a
      motion[6] or proposal, by adding one's voice to that of
      the mover or proposer.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Under common parliamentary rules used by many
         organizations, especially legislative bodies, a motion
         must be seconded in order to come properly before the
         deliberative body for discussion. Any motion[6] for
         which there is no second[8] dies for lack thereof.
         [PJC]
