   Introduction Sweden
   -------------------
                            Background: A military power during the 17th
                                        century, Sweden has not participated
                                        in any war in almost two centuries.
                                        An armed neutrality was preserved in
                                        both World Wars. Sweden's long-
                                        successful economic formula of a
                                        capitalist system interlarded with
                                        substantial welfare elements was
                                        challenged in the 1990s by high
                                        unemployment, rising maintenance
                                        costs, and a declining position in
                                        world markets. Indecision over the
                                        country's role in the political and
                                        economic integration of Europe
                                        delayed Sweden's entry into the EU
                                        until 1995, and waived the
                                        introduction of the euro in 1999.

   Economy Sweden
   --------------
                    Economy - overview: Aided by peace and neutrality for
                                        the whole 20th century, Sweden has
                                        achieved an enviable standard of
                                        living under a mixed system of high-
                                        tech capitalism and extensive
                                        welfare benefits. It has a modern
                                        distribution system, excellent
                                        internal and external
                                        communications, and a skilled labor
                                        force. Timber, hydropower, and iron
                                        ore constitute the resource base of
                                        an economy heavily oriented toward
                                        foreign trade. Privately owned firms
                                        account for about 90% of industrial
                                        output, of which the engineering
                                        sector accounts for 50% of output
                                        and exports. Agriculture accounts
                                        for only 2% of GDP and 2% of the
                                        jobs. The government's commitment to
                                        fiscal discipline resulted in a
                                        substantive budgetary surplus in
                                        2001, but is expected to shrink
                                        somewhat in 2002, due to the global
                                        economic slowdown, tax cuts, and
                                        spending increases. The Swedish
                                        central bank (the Riksbank) is
                                        focusing on price stability with an
                                        inflation target of 2% for 2002.
