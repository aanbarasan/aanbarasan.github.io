      <WordDefinition>Single \Sin"gle\, v. i.
   To take the irrregular gait called single-foot; -- said of a
   horse. See {Single-foot}.
   [1913 Webster]

         Many very fleet horses, when overdriven, adopt a
         disagreeable gait, which seems to be a cross between a
         pace and a trot, in which the two legs of one side are
         raised almost but not quite, simultaneously. Such
         horses are said to single, or to be single-footed. --W.
