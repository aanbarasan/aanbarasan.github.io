      <WordDefinition>Slight \Slight\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Slighted}; p. pr. &amp; vb. n.
   {Slighting}.]
   To disregard, as of little value and unworthy of notice; to
   make light of; as, to slight the divine commands. --Milton.
   [1913 Webster]

         The wretch who slights the bounty of the skies.
                                                  --Cowper.
   [1913 Webster]

   {To slight off}, to treat slightingly; to drive off; to
      remove. [R.] -- {To slight over}, to run over in haste; to
      perform superficially; to treat carelessly; as, to slight
      over a theme. ``They will but slight it over.'' --Bacon.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To neglect; disregard; disdain; scorn.

   Usage: {Slight}, {Neglect}. To slight is stronger than to
          neglect. We may neglect a duty or person from
          inconsiderateness, or from being over-occupied in
          other concerns. To slight is always a positive and
          intentional act, resulting from feelings of dislike or
          contempt. We ought to put a kind construction on what
          appears neglect on the part of a friend; but when he
          slights us, it is obvious that he is our friend no
          longer.
          [1913 Webster]

                Beware . . . lest the like befall . . .
                If they transgress and slight that sole command.
                                                  --Milton.
          [1913 Webster]

                This my long-sufferance, and my day of grace,
                Those who neglect and scorn shall never taste.
                                                  --Milton.
