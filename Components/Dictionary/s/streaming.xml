      <WordDefinition>streaming
     
        &lt;communications&gt; Playing {sound} or {video} in {real time} as
        it is downloaded over the {Internet} as opposed to storing it
        in a local file first.  A {plug-in} to a {web browser} such as
        {Netscape Navigator} decompresses and plays the data as it is
        transferred to your computer over the {World-Wide Web}.
        Streaming audio or video avoids the delay entailed in
        downloading an entire file and then playing it with a {helper
        application}.  Streaming requires a fast connection and a
        computer powerful enough to execute the decompression
        {algorithm} in {real time}.
