       same sound; thus, the i in ill is the short sound, not of
       i in isle, but of ee in eel, and the e in pet is the
       short sound of a in pate, etc. See {Quantity}, and Guide
       to Pronunciation, [sect][sect]22, 30.

      [1913 Webster]

   5. (Phonetics) A short sound, syllable, or vowel.
      [1913 Webster]

            If we compare the nearest conventional shorts and
            longs in English, as in ``bit'' and ``beat,''
            ``not'' and ``naught,'' we find that the short
            vowels are generally wide, the long narrow, besides
            being generally diphthongic as well. Hence,
            originally short vowels can be lengthened and yet
            kept quite distinct from the original longs. --H.
                                                  Sweet.
