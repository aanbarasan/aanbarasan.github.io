      <WordDefinition>Shoe
   Of various forms, from the mere sandal (q.v.) to the complete
   covering of the foot. The word so rendered (A.V.) in Deut.
   33:25, _min'al_, "a bar," is derived from a root meaning "to
   bolt" or "shut fast," and hence a fastness or fortress. The
   verse has accordingly been rendered "iron and brass shall be thy
   fortress," or, as in the Revised Version, "thy bars [marg.,
   "shoes"] shall be iron and brass."
