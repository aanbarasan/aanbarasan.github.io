      <WordDefinition>Sodom
   burning; the walled, a city in the vale of Siddim (Gen. 13:10;
   14:1-16). The wickedness of its inhabitants brought down upon it
   fire from heaven, by which it was destroyed (18:16-33; 19:1-29;
   Deut. 23:17). This city and its awful destruction are frequently
   alluded to in Scripture (Deut. 29:23; 32:32; Isa. 1:9, 10; 3:9;
   13:19; Jer. 23:14; Ezek. 16:46-56; Zeph. 2:9; Matt. 10:15; Rom.
   9:29; 2 Pet. 2:6, etc.). No trace of it or of the other cities
   of the plain has been discovered, so complete was their
   destruction. Just opposite the site of Zoar, on the south-west
   coast of the Dead Sea, is a range of low hills, forming a mass
   of mineral salt called Jebel Usdum, "the hill of Sodom." It has
   been concluded, from this and from other considerations, that
   the cities of the plain stood at the southern end of the Dead
   Sea. Others, however, with much greater probability, contend
   that they stood at the northern end of the sea. [in 1897].
