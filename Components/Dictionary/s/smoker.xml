      [Webster 1913 Suppl.]

   {black smoker}, a vent at the bottom of the ocean, usually at
      a mid-ocean ridge, through which large quantities of water
      carrying minerals flow, producing a jet of fluid with the
      appearance of black smoke. The ocean water in crevices
      below the vent is heated to temperatures near 400[deg] C,
      and dissolves quantities of metal salts, such as of
      copper, zinc, gold, and manganese. When the saturated
      mineral solutions exit the vent, cooling by contact with
      the ocean causes the metals to precipitate, mainly as
      sulfide or sulfate salts. Unusual forms of life such as
      {tube worms} have been found to live in the areas near
      black smokers. Additional information is available from [a
