      <WordDefinition>Sacrifice
   The offering up of sacrifices is to be regarded as a divine
   institution. It did not originate with man. God himself
   appointed it as the mode in which acceptable worship was to be
   offered to him by guilty man. The language and the idea of
   sacrifice pervade the whole Bible.
   
     Sacrifices were offered in the ante-diluvian age. The Lord
   clothed Adam and Eve with the skins of animals, which in all
   probability had been offered in sacrifice (Gen. 3:21). Abel
   offered a sacrifice "of the firstlings of his flock" (4:4; Heb.
   11:4). A distinction also was made between clean and unclean
   animals, which there is every reason to believe had reference to
   the offering up of sacrifices (Gen. 7:2, 8), because animals
   were not given to man as food till after the Flood.
   
     The same practice is continued down through the patriarchal
   age (Gen. 8:20; 12:7; 13:4, 18; 15:9-11; 22:1-18, etc.). In the
   Mosaic period of Old Testament history definite laws were
   prescribed by God regarding the different kinds of sacrifices
   that were to be offered and the manner in which the offering was
   to be made. The offering of stated sacrifices became indeed a
   prominent and distinctive feature of the whole period (Ex.
   12:3-27; Lev. 23:5-8; Num. 9:2-14). (See {ALTAR}.)
   
     We learn from the Epistle to the Hebrews that sacrifices had
   in themselves no value or efficacy. They were only the "shadow
   of good things to come," and pointed the worshippers forward to
   the coming of the great High Priest, who, in the fullness of the
   time, "was offered once for all to bear the sin of many."
   Sacrifices belonged to a temporary economy, to a system of types
   and emblems which served their purposes and have now passed
   away. The "one sacrifice for sins" hath "perfected for ever them
   that are sanctified."
   
     Sacrifices were of two kinds: 1. Unbloody, such as (1)
   first-fruits and tithes; (2) meat and drink-offerings; and (3)
   incense. 2. Bloody, such as (1) burnt-offerings; (2)
   peace-offerings; and (3) sin and trespass offerings. (See {OFFERINGS}.)
