      <WordDefinition>Silver
   used for a great variety of purposes, as may be judged from the
   frequent references to it in Scripture. It first appears in
   commerce in Gen. 13:2; 23:15, 16. It was largely employed for
   making vessels for the sanctuary in the wilderness (Ex. 26:19;
   27:17; Num. 7:13, 19; 10:2). There is no record of its having
   been found in Syria or Palestine. It was brought in large
   quantities by foreign merchants from abroad, from Spain and
   India and other countries probably.
