        1. (computer peripheral) See {scanner}.
     
        2. (circuit design) See {scan design}.
     
        3. ({functional programming}) See {scanl}, {scanr}.
     
        4. &lt;storage, algorithm&gt; An algorithm for scheduling multiple
        accesses to a disk.  A number of requests are ordered
        according to the data's position on the storage device.  This
        reduces the disk arm movement to one "scan" or sweep across
        the whole disk in the worst case.  The serivce time can be
        estimated from the disk's track-to-track {seek} time, maximum
        seek time (one scan), and maximum {rotational latency}.
     
        {Scan-EDF} is a variation on this.
