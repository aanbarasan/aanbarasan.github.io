      <WordDefinition>splat
     
        1. Name used in many places (DEC, IBM, and others) for the
        asterisk ("*") character (ASCII 0101010).  This may derive
        from the "squashed-bug" appearance of the asterisk on many
        early line printers.
     
        2. Name used by some {MIT} people for the "#" character (ASCII
        35).
     
        3. (Rochester Institute of Technology) The {feature key} on a
        Mac (same as {alt}).
     
        4. An obsolete name used by some people for the
        {Stanford}/{ITS} {extended ASCII} circle-x character.  This
        character is also called "blobby" and "frob", among other
        names; it is sometimes used by mathematicians as a notation
        for "tensor product".
     
        5. An obsolete name for the semi-mythical {Stanford} {extended
        ASCII} circle-plus character.
     
        See also {ASCII}.
