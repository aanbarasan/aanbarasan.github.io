      <WordDefinition>Stranger
   This word generally denotes a person from a foreign land
   residing in Palestine. Such persons enjoyed many privileges in
   common with the Jews, but still were separate from them. The
   relation of the Jews to strangers was regulated by special laws
   (Deut. 23:3; 24:14-21; 25:5; 26:10-13). A special signification
   is also sometimes attached to this word. In Gen. 23:4 it denotes
   one resident in a foreign land; Ex. 23:9, one who is not a Jew;
   Num. 3:10, one who is not of the family of Aaron; Ps. 69:8, an
   alien or an unknown person. The Jews were allowed to purchase
   strangers as slaves (Lev. 25:44, 45), and to take usury from
   them (Deut. 23:20).
