   {Stratagem}.]

      projecting campaigns and directing great military
      movements; generalship.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. The use of stratagem or artifice.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. a plan of action encompassing the methods to be adopted
      from beginning to end of a task or endeavor, focussing on
      the general methods; -- contrasted with tactics, which is
