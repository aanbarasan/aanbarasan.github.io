      <WordDefinition>Stone
   Stones were commonly used for buildings, also as memorials of
   important events (Gen. 28:18; Josh. 24:26, 27; 1 Sam. 7:12,
   etc.). They were gathered out of cultivated fields (Isa. 5:2;
   comp. 2 Kings 3:19). This word is also used figuratively of
   believers (1 Pet. 2:4, 5), and of the Messiah (Ps. 118:22; Isa.
   28:16; Matt. 21:42; Acts 4:11, etc.). In Dan. 2:45 it refers
   also to the Messiah. He is there described as "cut out of the
   mountain." (See {ROCK}.)
   
     A "heart of stone" denotes great insensibility (1 Sam. 25:37).
   
     Stones were set up to commemorate remarkable events, as by
   Jacob at Bethel (Gen. 28:18), at Padan-aram (35:4), and on the
   occasion of parting with Laban (31:45-47); by Joshua at the
   place on the banks of the Jordan where the people first "lodged"
   after crossing the river (Josh. 6:8), and also in "the midst of
   Jordan," where he erected another set of twelve stones (4:1-9);
   and by Samuel at "Ebenezer" (1 Sam. 7:12).
