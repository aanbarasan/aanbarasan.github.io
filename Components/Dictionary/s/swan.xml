      <WordDefinition>Swan \Swan\ (sw[o^]n), n. [AS. swan; akin to D. zwaan, OHG.
   swan, G. schwan, Icel. svanr, Sw. svan, Dan. svane; and
   perhaps to E. sound something audible.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) Any one of numerous species of large aquatic
      birds belonging to {Cygnus}, {Olor}, and allied genera of
      the subfamily {Cygnin[ae]}. They have a large and strong
      beak and a long neck, and are noted for their graceful
      movements when swimming. Most of the northern species are
      white. In literature the swan was fabled to sing a
      melodious song, especially at the time of its death.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The European white, or mute, swan ({Cygnus gibbus}),
         which is most commonly domesticated, bends its neck in
         an S-shaped curve. The whistling, or trumpeting, swans
         of the genus {Olor} do not bend the neck in an S-shaped
         curve, and are noted for their loud and sonorous cry,
         due to complex convolutions of the windpipe. To this
         genus belong the European whooper, or whistling swan
         ({Olor cygnus}), the American whistling swan ({O.
         Columbianus}), and the trumpeter swan ({O.
         buccinator}). The Australian black swan ({Chenopis
         atrata}) is dull black with white on the wings, and has
         the bill carmine, crossed with a white band. It is a
         very graceful species and is often domesticated. The
         South American black-necked swan ({Sthenelides
         melancorypha}) is a very beautiful and graceful
         species, entirely white, except the head and neck,
         which are dark velvety seal-brown. Its bill has a
         double bright rose-colored knob.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. Fig.: An appellation for a sweet singer, or a poet noted
      for grace and melody; as Shakespeare is called the swan of
      Avon.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. (Astron.) The constellation Cygnus.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Swan goose} (Zo["o]l.), a bird of India ({Cygnopsis
      cygnoides}) resembling both the swan and the goose.

   {Swan shot}, a large size of shot used in fowling.
      [1913 Webster]
