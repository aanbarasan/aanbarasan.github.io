      <WordDefinition>swap
     
        &lt;operating system&gt; To move a program from fast-access memory
        to a slow-access memory ("swap out"), or vice versa ("swap
        in").  The term often refers specifically to the use of a
        {hard disk} (or a {swap file}) as {virtual memory} or "swap
        space".
     
        When a program is to be executed, possibly as determined by a
        {scheduler}, it is swapped into {core} for processing; when it
        can no longer continue executing for some reason, or the
        scheduler decides its {time slice} has expired, it is swapped
        out again.
     
        This contrasts with "paging" systems in which only parts of a
        program's memory is transfered.

      <WordDefinition>swap vt. 1. [techspeak] To move information from a fast-access memory
   to a slow-access memory (`swap out'), or vice versa (`swap in'). Often
   refers specifically to the use of disks as `virtual memory'. As pieces
   of data or program are needed, they are swapped into {core} for
   processing; when they are no longer needed they may be swapped out
   again. 2. The jargon use of these terms analogizes people's short-term
   memories with core. Cramming for an exam might be spoken of as swapping
   in. If you temporarily forget someone's name, but then remember it, your
   excuse is that it was swapped out. To `keep something swapped in' means
   to keep it fresh in your memory: "I reread the TECO manual every few
   months to keep it swapped in." If someone interrupts you just as you got
   a good idea, you might say "Wait a moment while I swap this out",
   implying that a piece of paper is your extra-somatic memory and that if
   you don't swap the idea out by writing it down it will get overwritten
   and lost as you talk. Compare {page in}, {page out}.
