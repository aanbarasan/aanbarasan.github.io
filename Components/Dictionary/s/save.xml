      <WordDefinition>SAVE
     
        An {assembler} for the {Burroughs 220} by Melvin Conway (see
        {Conway's Law}).  The name "SAVE" didn't stand for anything,
        it was just that you lost fewer card decks and listings
        because they all had SAVE written on them.

      <WordDefinition>save
     
        &lt;editor, programming, storage&gt; To copy {data} to a more
        permanent form of storage.  The term is commonly used for when
        some kind of document editing {application program} writes the
        current document from {RAM} to a {file} on {hard disk} at the
        request of the user.  The implication is that the user might
        later {load} the file back into the editor again to view it,
        print it, or continue editing it.  Saving a document makes it
        safe from the effects of power failure.
     
        The "document" might actually be anything, e.g. a {word
        processor} document, the current state of a game, a piece of
        music, a {web site}, or a memory image of some program being
        executed (though the term "dump" would probably be more common
        here).
     
        Data can be saved to any kind of (writable) storage: hard
        disk, {floppy disk}, {CD-R}; either locally or via a
        {network}.
     
        A program might save its data without any explicit user
        request, e.g. periodically as a precaution ("auto save"), or
        if it forms part of a {pipeline} of processes which pass data
        via intermediate files.  In the latter case the term suggests
        all data is written in a single operation whereas "output"
        might be a continuous flow, in true pipeline fashion.
     
        When copying several files from one storage medium to another,
        the terms "back-up", "dump", or "archive" would be used rather
        than "save".  The term "store" is similar to "save" but
        typically applies to copying a single item of data, e.g. a
        number, from a {processor}'s {register} to {RAM}.
