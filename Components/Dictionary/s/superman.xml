      [Webster 1913 Suppl.]

   2. a fictional character of cartoons, movies and television,
      with superhuman powers such as great strength, the ability
      to fly, and x-ray vision. In the cartoon tale, he was born
      on the planet Krypton and sent by his parents into space
      before it exploded, and landed on earth, where he fights
      for "truth, justice, and the American way". He works

      constantly trying to avoid the uncovering of his secret
      identity by a co-worker, Lois Lane.
