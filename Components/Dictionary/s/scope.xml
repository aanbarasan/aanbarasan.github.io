      <WordDefinition>scope
     
        &lt;programming&gt; The scope of an identifier is the region of a
        program source within which it represents a certain thing.
        This usually extends from the place where it is declared to
        the end of the smallest enclosing block (begin/end or
        procedure/function body).  An inner block may contain a
        redeclaration of the same identifier in which case the scope
        of the outer declaration does not include (is "shadowed" or
        "{occlude}d" by) the scope of the inner.
     
        See also {activation record}, {dynamic scope}, {lexical
        scope}.
