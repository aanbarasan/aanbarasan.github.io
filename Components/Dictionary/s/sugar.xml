      <WordDefinition>Sugar \Sug"ar\, n. [OE. sugre, F. sucre (cf. It. zucchero, Sp.
   az['u]car), fr. Ar. sukkar, assukkar, fr. Skr. [,c]arkar[=a]
   sugar, gravel; cf. Per. shakar. Cf. {Saccharine}, {Sucrose}.]
   1. A sweet white (or brownish yellow) crystalline substance,
      of a sandy or granular consistency, obtained by
      crystallizing the evaporated juice of certain plants, as
      the sugar cane, sorghum, beet root, sugar maple, etc. It
      is used for seasoning and preserving many kinds of food
      and drink. Ordinary sugar is essentially sucrose. See the
      Note below.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The term sugar includes several commercial grades, as
         the white or refined, granulated, loaf or lump, and the
         raw brown or muscovado. In a more general sense, it
         includes several distinct chemical compounds, as the
         glucoses, or grape sugars (including glucose proper,
         dextrose, and levulose), and the sucroses, or true
         sugars (as cane sugar). All sugars are carbohydrates.
         See {Carbohydrate}. The glucoses, or grape sugars, are
         ketone alcohols of the formula {C6H12O6}, and they turn
         the plane of polarization to the right or the left.
         They are produced from the amyloses and sucroses, as by
         the action of heat and acids of ferments, and are
         themselves decomposed by fermentation into alcohol and
         carbon dioxide. The only sugar (called acrose) as yet
         produced artificially belongs to this class. The
         sucroses, or cane sugars, are doubled glucose
         anhydrides of the formula {C12H22O11}. They are usually
         not fermentable as such (cf. {Sucrose}), and they act
         on polarized light.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. By extension, anything resembling sugar in taste or
      appearance; as, sugar of lead (lead acetate), a poisonous
      white crystalline substance having a sweet taste.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Compliment or flattery used to disguise or render
      acceptable something obnoxious; honeyed or soothing words.
