      <WordDefinition>SAINT, n.  A dead sinner revised and edited.
    The Duchess of Orleans relates that the irreverent old
calumniator, Marshal Villeroi, who in his youth had known St. Francis
de Sales, said, on hearing him called saint:  "I am delighted to hear
that Monsieur de Sales is a saint.  He was fond of saying indelicate
things, and used to cheat at cards.  In other respects he was a
perfect gentleman, though a fool."

      <WordDefinition>Saint
   one separated from the world and consecrated to God; one holy by
   profession and by covenant; a believer in Christ (Ps. 16:3; Rom.
   1:7; 8:27; Phil. 1:1; Heb. 6:10).
   
     The "saints" spoken of in Jude 1:14 are probably not the
   disciples of Christ, but the "innumerable company of angels"
   (Heb. 12:22; Ps. 68:17), with reference to Deut. 33:2.
   
     This word is also used of the holy dead (Matt. 27:52; Rev.
   18:24). It was not used as a distinctive title of the apostles
   and evangelists and of a "spiritual nobility" till the fourth
   century. In that sense it is not a scriptural title.
