      <WordDefinition>Soap
   (Jer. 2:22; Mal. 3:2; Heb. borith), properly a vegetable alkali,
   obtained from the ashes of certain plants, particularly the
   salsola kali (saltwort), which abounds on the shores of the Dead
   Sea and of the Mediterranean. It does not appear that the
   Hebrews were acquainted with what is now called "soap," which is
   a compound of alkaline carbonates with oleaginous matter. The
   word "purely" in Isa. 1:25 (R.V., "throughly;" marg., "as with
   lye") is lit. "as with _bor_." This word means "clearness," and
   hence also that which makes clear, or pure, alkali. "The
   ancients made use of alkali mingled with oil, instead of soap
   (Job 9:30), and also in smelting metals, to make them melt and
   flow more readily and purely" (Gesenius).

      <WordDefinition>Soap \Soap\, n. [OE. sope, AS. s[=a]pe; akin to D. zeep, G.
   seife, OHG. seifa, Icel. s[=a]pa, Sw. s?pa, Dan. s?be, and
   perhaps to AS. s[=i]pan to drip, MHG. s[=i]fen, and L. sebum
   tallow. Cf. {Saponaceous}.]
   A substance which dissolves in water, thus forming a lather,
   and is used as a cleansing agent. Soap is produced by
   combining fats or oils with alkalies or alkaline earths,
   usually by boiling, and consists of salts of sodium,
   potassium, etc., with the fatty acids (oleic, stearic,
   palmitic, etc.). See the Note below, and cf.
   {Saponification}. By extension, any compound of similar
   composition or properties, whether used as a cleaning agent
   or not.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: In general, soaps are of two classes, hard and soft.
         Calcium, magnesium, lead, etc., form soaps, but they
         are insoluble and useless.
         [1913 Webster]

               The purifying action of soap depends upon the
               fact that it is decomposed by a large quantity of
               water into free alkali and an insoluble acid
               salt. The first of these takes away the fatty
               dirt on washing, and the latter forms the soap
               lather which envelops the greasy matter and thus
               tends to remove it.                --Roscoe &amp;
                                                  Schorlemmer.
         [1913 Webster]
