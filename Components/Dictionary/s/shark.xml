      <WordDefinition>Shark \Shark\, n. [Of uncertain origin; perhaps through OF. fr.
   carcharus a kind of dogfish, Gr. karchari`as, so called from
   its sharp teeth, fr. ka`rcharos having sharp or jagged teeth;
   or perhaps named from its rapacity (cf. {Shark}, v. t. &amp; i.);
   cf. Corn. scarceas.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) Any one of numerous species of elasmobranch
      fishes of the order Plagiostomi, found in all seas.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Some sharks, as the basking shark and the whale shark,
         grow to an enormous size, the former becoming forty
         feet or more, and the latter sixty feet or more, in
         length. Most of them are harmless to man, but some are
         exceedingly voracious. The man-eating sharks mostly
         belong to the genera {Carcharhinus}, {Carcharodon}, and
         related genera. They have several rows of large sharp
         teeth with serrated edges, as the great white shark
         ({Carcharodon carcharias} or {Carcharodon Rondeleti})
         of tropical seas, and the great blue shark
         ({Carcharhinus glaucus}) of all tropical and temperate
         seas. The former sometimes becomes thirty-six feet
         long, and is the most voracious and dangerous species
         known. The rare man-eating shark of the United States
         coast ({Charcarodon Atwoodi}) is thought by some to be
         a variety, or the young, of {C. carcharias}. The dusky
         shark ({Carcharhinus obscurus}), and the smaller blue
         shark ({C. caudatus}), both common species on the coast
         of the United States, are of moderate size and not
         dangerous. They feed on shellfish and bottom fishes.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. A rapacious, artful person; a sharper. [Colloq.]
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Trickery; fraud; petty rapine; as, to live upon the shark.
