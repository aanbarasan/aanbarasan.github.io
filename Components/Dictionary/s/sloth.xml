      idleness.

            sloth.                                --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

            Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labor wears.

   3. (Zo["o]l.) Any one of several species of arboreal
      edentates constituting the family {Bradypodid[ae]}, and
      the suborder Tardigrada. They have long exserted limbs and
      long prehensile claws. Both jaws are furnished with teeth
      (see Illust. of {Edentata}), and the ears and tail are
      rudimentary. They inhabit South and Central America and
      Mexico.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The three-toed sloths belong to the genera {Bradypus}
         and {Arctopithecus}, of which several species have been
         described. They have three toes on each foot. The
         best-known species are collared sloth ({Bradypus
         tridactylus}), and the ai ({Arctopitheus ai}). The
         two-toed sloths, consisting the genus {Cholopus}, have
         two toes on each fore foot and three on each hind foot.
         The best-known is the unau ({Cholopus didactylus}) of
         South America. See {Unau}. Another species ({C.
         Hoffmanni}) inhabits Central America. Various large
         extinct terrestrial edentates, such as Megatherium and
         Mylodon, are often called sloths.
