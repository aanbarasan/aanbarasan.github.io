      <WordDefinition>sponge
     
        A special case of a {Unix} {filter} that reads its entire
        input before writing any output; the canonical example is a
        sort utility.  Unlike most filters, a sponge can conveniently
        overwrite the input file with the output data stream.  If a
        file system has {file versioning} (as {ITS} did and {VMS} does
        now) the sponge/filter distinction loses its usefulness,
        because directing filter output would just write a new
        version.
     
        See also {slurp}.
