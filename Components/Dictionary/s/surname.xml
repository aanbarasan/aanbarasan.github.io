      <WordDefinition>Surname \Sur"name`\, n. [Pref. sur + name; really a substitution
   for OE. sournoun, from F. surnom. See {Sur-}, and {Noun},
   {Name}.]
   1. A name or appellation which is added to, or over and
      above, the baptismal or Christian name, and becomes a
      family name.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Surnames originally designated occupation, estate,
         place of residence, or some particular thing or event
         that related to the person; thus, Edmund Ironsides;
         Robert Smith, or the smith; William Turner. Surnames
         are often also patronymics; as, John Johnson.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. An appellation added to the original name; an agnomen.
      ``My surname, Coriolanus.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: This word has been sometimes written sirname, as if it
         signified sire-name, or the name derived from one's
         father.
