      <WordDefinition>Spices
   aromatic substances, of which several are named in Ex. 30. They
   were used in the sacred anointing oil (Ex. 25:6; 35:8; 1 Chr.
   9:29), and in embalming the dead (2 Chr. 16:14; Luke 23:56;
   24:1; John 19:39, 40). Spices were stored by Hezekiah in his
   treasure-house (2 Kings 20:13; Isa. 39:2).
