      <WordDefinition>Salmon
   shady; or Zalmon (q.v.), a hill covered with dark forests, south
   of Shechem, from which Abimelech and his men gathered wood to
   burn that city (Judg. 9:48). In Ps. 68:14 the change from war to
   peace is likened to snow on the dark mountain, as some interpret
   the expression. Others suppose the words here mean that the
   bones of the slain left unburied covered the land, so that it
   seemed to be white as if covered with snow. The reference,
   however, of the psalm is probably to Josh. 11 and 12. The
   scattering of the kings and their followers is fitly likened
   unto the snow-flakes rapidly falling on the dark Salmon. It is
   the modern Jebel Suleiman.

      <WordDefinition>Salmon \Salm"on\ (s[a^]m"[u^]n), n.; pl. {Salmons} (-[u^]nz) or
   (collectively) {Salmon}. [OE. saumoun, salmon, F. saumon, fr.
   L. salmo, salmonis, perhaps from salire to leap. Cf. {Sally},
   v.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) Any one of several species of fishes of the
      genus {Salmo} and allied genera. The common salmon ({Salmo
      salar}) of Northern Europe and Eastern North America, and
      the California salmon, or quinnat, are the most important
      species. They are extensively preserved for food. See
      {Quinnat}.
      [1913 Webster]
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The salmons ascend rivers and penetrate to their head
         streams to spawn. They are remarkably strong fishes,
         and will even leap over considerable falls which lie in
         the way of their progress. The common salmon has been
         known to grow to the weight of seventy-five pounds;
         more generally it is from fifteen to twenty-five
         pounds. Young salmon are called parr, peal, smolt, and
         grilse. Among the true salmons are:

   {Black salmon}, or {Lake salmon}, the namaycush.

   {Dog salmon}, a salmon of Western North America
      ({Oncorhynchus keta}).

   {Humpbacked salmon}, a Pacific-coast salmon ({Oncorhynchus
      gorbuscha}).

   {King salmon}, the quinnat.

   {Landlocked salmon}, a variety of the common salmon (var.
      {Sebago}), long confined in certain lakes in consequence
      of obstructions that prevented it from returning to the
      sea. This last is called also {dwarf salmon}.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Among fishes of other families which are locally and
         erroneously called salmon are: the pike perch, called
         {jack salmon}; the spotted, or southern, squeteague;
         the cabrilla, called {kelp salmon}; young pollock,
         called {sea salmon}; and the California yellowtail.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. A reddish yellow or orange color, like the flesh of the
      salmon.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Salmon berry} (Bot.), a large red raspberry growing from
      Alaska to California, the fruit of the {Rubus Nutkanus}.
      

   {Salmon killer} (Zo["o]l.), a stickleback ({Gasterosteus
      cataphractus}) of Western North America and Northern Asia.
      

   {Salmon ladder}, {Salmon stair}. See {Fish ladder}, under
      {Fish}.

   {Salmon peel}, a young salmon.

   {Salmon pipe}, a certain device for catching salmon. --Crabb.

   {Salmon trout}. (Zo["o]l.)
      (a) The European sea trout ({Salmo trutta}). It resembles
          the salmon, but is smaller, and has smaller and more
          numerous scales.
      (b) The American namaycush.
      (c) A name that is also applied locally to the adult black
          spotted trout ({Salmo purpuratus}), and to the steel
          head and other large trout of the Pacific coast.

      <WordDefinition>Ceratodus \Ce*rat"o*dus\, n. [NL., fr. Gr. ke`ras, ke`ratos horn
   + ? tooth.] (Zo["o]l.)
   A genus of ganoid fishes, of the order Dipnoi, first known as
   Mesozoic fossil fishes; but recently two living species have
   been discovered in Australian rivers. They have lungs so well
   developed that they can leave the water and breathe in air.
   In Australia they are called {salmon} and {baramunda}. See
   {Dipnoi}, and {Archipterygium}.
