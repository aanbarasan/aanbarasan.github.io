      <WordDefinition>Slave
   Jer. 2:14 (A.V.), but not there found in the original. In Rev.
   18:13 the word "slaves" is the rendering of a Greek word meaning
   "bodies." The Hebrew and Greek words for slave are usually
   rendered simply "servant," "bondman," or "bondservant." Slavery
   as it existed under the Mosaic law has no modern parallel. That
   law did not originate but only regulated the already existing
   custom of slavery (Ex. 21:20, 21, 26, 27; Lev. 25:44-46; Josh.
   9:6-27). The gospel in its spirit and genius is hostile to
   slavery in every form, which under its influence is gradually
   disappearing from among men.
