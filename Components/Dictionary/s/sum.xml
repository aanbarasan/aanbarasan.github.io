        1. &lt;theory&gt; In {domain theory}, the sum A + B of two {domain}s
        contains all elements of both domains, modified to indicate
        which part of the union they come from, plus a new {bottom}
        element.  There are two constructor functions associated with
        the sum:
     
        	inA : A -&gt; A+B       inB : B -&gt; A+B
        	inA(a) = (0,a)	     inB(b) = (1,b)
     
        and a disassembly operation:
     
        	case d of {isA(x) -&gt; E1; isB(x) -&gt; E2}
     
        This can be generalised to arbitrary numbers of domains.
     
        See also {smash sum}, {disjoint union}.
     
        2. &lt;tool&gt; A {Unix} utility to calculate a 16-bit {checksum} of
        the data in a file.  It also displays the size of the file,
        either in {kilobyte}s or in 512-byte blocks.  The checksum may
        differ on machines with 16-bit and 32-bit ints.
     
        {Unix manual page}: sum(1).
