      <WordDefinition>STREAMS
     
        &lt;operating system&gt; A collection of {system calls}, {kernel}
        resources, and kernel utility routines that can create, use,
        and dismantle a {stream}.  A "stream head" provides the
        interface between the stream and the user processes.  Its
        principal function is to process STREAMS-related user system
        calls.  A "stream module" processes data that travel bewteen
        the stream head and driver.  The "stream end" provides the
        services of an external input/output device or an internal
        software driver.  The internal software driver is commonly
        called a {pseudo-device} driver.
     
        The STREAMS concept has been formalised in {Unix} {System V}.
        For example, {SVR4} implements {sockets} and {pipes} using
        STREAMS, resulting in pipe(2) openning bidirectional pipes.
