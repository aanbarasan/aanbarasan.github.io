   Introduction Somalia
   --------------------
                            Background: The SIAD BARRE regime was ousted in
                                        January 1991; turmoil, factional
                                        fighting, and anarchy have followed
                                        for eleven years. In May of 1991,
                                        northern clans declared an
                                        independent Republic of Somaliland
                                        that now includes the administrative
                                        regions of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed,
                                        Togdheer, Sanaag, and Sool. Although
                                        not recognized by any government,
                                        this entity has maintained a stable
                                        existence, aided by the overwhelming
                                        dominance of a ruling clan and
                                        economic infrastructure left behind
                                        by British, Russian, and American
                                        military assistance programs. The
                                        regions of Bari and Nugaal comprise
                                        a neighboring self-declared
                                        autonomous state of Puntland, which
                                        has been self-governing since 1998,
                                        but does not aim at independence; it
                                        has also made strides towards
                                        reconstructing legitimate,
                                        representative government. Puntland
                                        also claims Sool and eastern Sanaag.
                                        Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN
                                        humanitarian effort (primarily in
                                        the south) was able to alleviate
                                        famine conditions, but when the UN
                                        withdrew in 1995, having suffered
                                        significant casualties, order still
                                        had not been restored. A
                                        Transitional National Government
                                        (TNG) was created in August 2000 in
                                        Arta, Djibouti which was attended by
                                        a broad representation of Somali
                                        clans. The TNG has a three-year
                                        mandate to create a permanent
                                        national Somali government. The TNG
                                        does not recognize Somaliland as an
                                        independent republic but so far has
                                        been unable to reunite either
                                        Somaliland or Puntland with the
                                        unstable regions in the south.
                                        Numerous warlords and factions are
                                        still fighting for control of
                                        Mogadishu and the other southern
                                        regions. Suspicion of Somali links
                                        with global terrorism complicate the
                                        picture.

                                        counting in Somalia is complicated
                                        by the large number of nomads and by

   Economy Somalia
   ---------------
                    Economy - overview: One of the world's poorest and least
                                        developed countries, Somalia has few
                                        resources and is prone to drought.
                                        Moreover, much of the economy has
                                        been devastated by civil war since
                                        1991. Agriculture is the most
                                        important sector, with livestock
                                        accounting for about 40% of GDP and
                                        about 65% of export earnings. Nomads
                                        and semi-nomads, who are dependent
                                        upon livestock for their livelihood,
                                        make up a large portion of the
                                        population. Livestock, hides,
                                        charcoal, and bananas are Somalia's
                                        principal exports, while sugar,
                                        sorghum, corn, fish, qat, and
                                        machined goods are the principal
                                        imports. Somalia's small industrial
                                        sector, based on the processing of
                                        agricultural products, has largely
                                        been looted and sold as scrap metal.
                                        Despite the seeming anarchy,
                                        Somalia's service sector has managed
                                        to survive and grow.
                                        Telecommunication firms provide
                                        wireless services in most major
                                        cities and offer the lowest
                                        international call rates on the
                                        continent. In the absence of a
                                        formal banking sector, money
                                        exchange services have sprouted
                                        throughout the country, handling
                                        between $200 million and $500
                                        million in remittances annually.
                                        Mogadishu's main market offers a
                                        variety of goods from food to the
                                        newest electronic gadgets. Hotels
                                        continue to operate, and security is
                                        provided by militias. Ongoing civil
                                        disturbances and clan rivalries,
                                        however, have interfered with any
                                        broad-based economic development and
                                        international aid arrangements. The
                                        failure of spring rains caused major
                                        food shortages in the south in 2001.
                                        Economic data is scare and prone to
                                        a wide margin of error.
