      <WordDefinition>Sergeant \Ser"geant\, n. [F. sergent, fr. L. serviens, -entis,
   p. pr. of servire to serve. See {Serve}, and cf. {Servant}.]
   [Written also {serjeant}. Both spellings are authorized. In
   England {serjeant} is usually preferred, except for military
   officers. In the United States {sergeant} is common for civil
   officers also.]
   1. Formerly, in England, an officer nearly answering to the
      more modern bailiff of the hundred; also, an officer whose
      duty was to attend on the king, and on the lord high
      steward in court, to arrest traitors and other offenders.
      He is now called sergeant-at-arms, and two of these
      officers, by allowance of the sovereign, attend on the
      houses of Parliament (one for each house) to execute their
      commands, and another attends the Court Chancery.
      [1913 Webster]

            The sergeant of the town of Rome them sought.
                                                  --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

            The magistrates sent the serjeant, saying, Let those
            men go.                               --Acts xvi.
                                                  35.
      [1913 Webster]

            This fell sergeant, Death,
            Is strict in his arrest.              --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Mil.) In a company, battery, or troop, a noncommissioned
      officer next in rank above a corporal, whose duty is to
      instruct recruits in discipline, to form the ranks, etc.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In the United States service, besides the sergeants
         belonging to the companies there are, in each regiment,
         a sergeant major, who is the chief noncommissioned
         officer, and has important duties as the assistant to
         the adjutant; a quartermaster sergeant, who assists the
         quartermaster; a color sergeant, who carries the
         colors; and a commissary sergeant, who assists in the
