      <WordDefinition>Sword
   of the Hebrew was pointed, sometimes two-edged, was worn in a
   sheath, and suspended from the girdle (Ex. 32:27; 1 Sam. 31:4; 1
   Chr. 21:27; Ps. 149:6: Prov. 5:4; Ezek. 16:40; 21:3-5).
   
     It is a symbol of divine chastisement (Deut. 32:25; Ps. 7:12;
   78:62), and of a slanderous tongue (Ps. 57:4; 64:3; Prov.
   12:18). The word of God is likened also to a sword (Heb. 4:12;
   Eph. 6:17; Rev. 1:16). Gideon's watchword was, "The sword of the
   Lord" (Judg. 7:20).
