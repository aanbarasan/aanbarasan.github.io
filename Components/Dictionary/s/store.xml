        [probably from "main store"] In some varieties of Commonwealth
        hackish, the preferred synonym for {core}.  Thus, "bringing a
        program into store" means not that one is returning
        shrink-wrapped software but that a program is being {swap}ped
        in.

      retail; a shop. [U.S. &amp; British Colonies]
      [1913 Webster]

   4. pl. Articles, especially of food, accumulated for some
      specific object; supplies, as of provisions, arms,
      ammunition, and the like; as, the stores of an army, of a
      ship, of a family.
      [1913 Webster]

                                                  --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

   {In store}, in a state of accumulation; in keeping; hence, in
      a state of readiness. ``I have better news in store for
      thee.'' --Shak.

   {To set store by}, to value greatly; to have a high

   {To tell no store of}, to make no account of; to consider of
      no importance.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Fund; supply; abundance; plenty; accumulation;

   Usage: {Store}, {Shop}. The English call the place where
          goods are sold (however large or splendid it may be) a
          shop, and confine the word store to its original
          meaning; viz., a warehouse, or place where goods are
          stored. In America the word store is applied to all
          places, except the smallest, where goods are sold. In
          some British colonies the word store is used as in the
          United States.
          [1913 Webster]

                In his needy shop a tortoise hung,
                An alligator stuffed, and other skins
                Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
                A beggarly account of empty boxes. --Shak.
          [1913 Webster]

                                                  --Milton.
