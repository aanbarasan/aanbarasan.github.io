      <WordDefinition>Super- \Su"per-\ [L. super over, above; akin to Gr. ?, L. sub
   under, and E. over. See {Over}, and cf. {Hyper-}, {Sub-},
   {Supra-}, {Sur-}.]
   1. A prefix signifying above, over, beyond, and hence often
      denoting in a superior position, in excess, over and
      above, in addition, exceedingly; as in superimpose,
      supersede, supernatural, superabundance.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Chem.) A prefix formerly much used to denote that the
      ingredient to the name of which it was prefixed was
      present in a large, or unusually large, proportion as
      compared with the other ingredients; as in calcium
      superphosphate. It has been superseded by per-, bi-, di-,
      acid, etc. (as peroxide, bicarbonate, disulphide, and acid
      sulphate), which retain the old meanings of super-, but
      with sharper definition. Cf. {Acid}, a., {Bi-}, {Di-}, and
      {Per-}.
