      <WordDefinition>Reveal \Re*veal"\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Revealed}; p. pr. &amp; vb.
   n. {Revealing}.] [F. r['e]v['e]ler, L. revelare, revelatum,
   to unveil, reveal; pref. re- re- + velare to veil; fr. velum
   a veil. See {Veil}.]
   1. To make known (that which has been concealed or kept
      secret); to unveil; to disclose; to show.
      [1913 Webster]

            Light was the wound, the prince's care unknown,
            She might not, would not, yet reveal her own.
                                                  --Waller.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Specifically, to communicate (that which could not be
      known or discovered without divine or supernatural
      instruction or agency).
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To communicate; disclose; divulge; unveil; uncover;
        open; discover; impart; show.

   Usage: See {Communicate}. -- {Reveal}, {Divulge}. To reveal
          is literally to lift the veil, and thus make known
          what was previously concealed; to divulge is to
          scatter abroad among the people, or make publicly
          known. A mystery or hidden doctrine may be revealed;
          something long confined to the knowledge of a few is
          at length divulged. ``Time, which reveals all things,
          is itself not to be discovered.'' --Locke. ``A tragic
          history of facts divulged.'' --Wordsworth.
          [1913 Webster]
