      <WordDefinition>robot
     
        1. &lt;robotics&gt; A mechanical device for performing a task which
        might otherwise be done by a human, e.g. spraying paint on
        cars.
     
        See also {cybernetics}.
     
        2. &lt;chat&gt; An {IRC} or {MUD} user who is actually a program.
        On IRC, typically the robot provides some useful service.
        Examples are {NickServ}, which tries to prevent random users
        from adopting {nick}s already claimed by others, and MsgServ,
        which allows one to send {asynchronous} messages to be
        delivered when the recipient signs on.  Also common are
        "annoybots", such as KissServ, which perform no useful
        function except to send cute messages to other people.
        Service robots are less common on {MUD}s; but some others,
        such as the "Julia" robot active in 1990--91, have been
        remarkably impressive {Turing test} experiments, able to pass
        as human for as long as ten or fifteen minutes of
        conversation.
     
        3. &lt;World-Wide Web&gt; {spider}.
