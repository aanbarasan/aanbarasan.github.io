      <WordDefinition>REP
     
        &lt;programming&gt; A directive used in {IBM} {object code} {card
        decks} (and later {PTF Tapes}) to REPlace fragments of already
        assembled or compiled object code prior to {link edit}.
        Recompiling or reassembling the {source code} to produce a
        whole new object module was only possible if the {source code}
        was available, which it rarely was (if you had the object you
        were lucky!)  It was also quicker to apply incremental changes
        with REP cards and they also circumvented the {checksums} and
        {card sequence numbers} present in the object code.
