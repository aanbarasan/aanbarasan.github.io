      <WordDefinition>reduction
     
        (Or "contraction") The process of transforming an expression
        according to certain reduction rules.  The most important
        forms are {beta reduction} (application of a {lambda
        abstraction} to one or more argument expressions) and {delta
        reduction} (application of a mathematical function to the
        required number of arguments).
     
        An {evaluation strategy} (or {reduction strategy}), determines
        which part of an expression (which redex) to reduce first.
        There are many such strategies.
     
        See {graph reduction}, {string reduction}, {normal order
        reduction}, {applicative order reduction}, {parallel
        reduction}, {alpha conversion}, {beta conversion}, {delta
        conversion}, {eta conversion}.
