      <WordDefinition>Rosh
   (Ezek. 38:2, 3; 39:1) is rendered "chief" in the Authorized
   Version. It is left untranslated as a proper name in the Revised
   Version. Some have supposed that the Russians are here meant, as
   one of the three Scythian tribes of whom Magog was the prince.
   They invaded the land of Judah in the days of Josiah. Herodotus,
   the Greek historian, says: "For twenty-eight years the Scythians
   ruled over Asia, and things were turned upside down by their
   violence and contempt." (See {BETHSHEAN}.)
