      <WordDefinition>Rock
   (Heb. tsur), employed as a symbol of God in the Old Testament (1
   Sam. 2:2; 2 Sam. 22:3; Isa. 17:10; Ps. 28:1; 31:2,3; 89:26;
   95:1); also in the New Testament (Matt. 16:18; Rom. 9:33; 1 Cor.
   10:4). In Dan. 2:45 the Chaldaic form of the Hebrew word is
   translated "mountain." It ought to be translated "rock," as in
   Hab. 1:12 in the Revised Version. The "rock" from which the
   stone is cut there signifies the divine origin of Christ. (See {STONE}.)
