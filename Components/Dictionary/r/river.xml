      <WordDefinition>River
   (1.) Heb. 'aphik, properly the channel or ravine that holds
   water (2 Sam. 22:16), translated "brook," "river," "stream," but
   not necessarily a perennial stream (Ezek. 6:3; 31:12; 32:6;
   34:13).
   
     (2.) Heb. nahal, in winter a "torrent," in summer a "wady" or
   valley (Gen. 32:23; Deut. 2:24; 3:16; Isa. 30:28; Lam. 2:18;
   Ezek. 47:9).
   
     These winter torrents sometimes come down with great
   suddenness and with desolating force. A distinguished traveller
   thus describes his experience in this matter:, "I was encamped
   in Wady Feiran, near the base of Jebel Serbal, when a tremendous
   thunderstorm burst upon us. After little more than an hour's
   rain, the water rose so rapidly in the previously dry wady that
   I had to run for my life, and with great difficulty succeeded in
   saving my tent and goods; my boots, which I had not time to pick
   up, were washed away. In less than two hours a dry desert wady
   upwards of 300 yards broad was turned into a foaming torrent
   from 8 to 10 feet deep, roaring and tearing down and bearing
   everything upon it, tangled masses of tamarisks, hundreds of
   beautiful palmtrees, scores of sheep and goats, camels and
   donkeys, and even men, women, and children, for a whole
   encampment of Arabs was washed away a few miles above me. The
   storm commenced at five in the evening; at half-past nine the
   waters were rapidly subsiding, and it was evident that the flood
   had spent its force." (Comp. Matt. 7:27; Luke 6:49.)
   
     (3.) Nahar, a "river" continuous and full, a perennial stream,
   as the Jordan, the Euphrates (Gen. 2:10; 15:18; Deut. 1:7; Ps.
   66:6; Ezek. 10:15).
   
     (4.) Tel'alah, a conduit, or water-course (1 Kings 18:32; 2
   Kings 18:17; 20:20; Job 38:25; Ezek. 31:4).
   
     (5.) Peleg, properly "waters divided", i.e., streams divided,
   throughout the land (Ps. 1:3); "the rivers [i.e., 'divisions']
   of waters" (Job 20:17; 29:6; Prov. 5:16).
   
     (6.) Ye'or, i.e., "great river", probably from an Egyptian
   word (Aur), commonly applied to the Nile (Gen. 41:1-3), but also
   to other rivers (Job 28:10; Isa. 33:21).
   
     (7.) Yubhal, "a river" (Jer. 17:8), a full flowing stream.
   
     (8.) 'Ubhal, "a river" (Dan. 8:2).
