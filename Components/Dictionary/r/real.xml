      Law), a burden imposed upon one estate in favor of another
      estate of another proprietor. --Erskine. --Bouvier.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Actual; true; genuine; authentic.

   Usage: {Real}, {Actual}. Real represents a thing to be a
          substantive existence; as, a real, not imaginary,
          occurrence. Actual refers to it as acted or performed;
          and, hence, when we wish to prove a thing real, we
          often say, ``It actually exists,'' ``It has actually
          been done.'' Thus its reality is shown by its
          actuality. Actual, from this reference to being acted,
          has recently received a new signification, namely,
          present; as, the actual posture of affairs; since what
          is now in action, or going on, has, of course, a
          present existence. An actual fact; a real sentiment.
          [1913 Webster]

                For he that but conceives a crime in thought,
                Contracts the danger of an actual fault.
                                                  --Dryden.
          [1913 Webster]

                Our simple ideas are all real; all agree to the
                reality of things.                --Locke.

      <WordDefinition>Real \Re"al\ (r[=e]"al), n. [Sp., fr. real royal, L. regalis.
   See {Regal}, and cf. {Ree} a coin.]
   A small Spanish silver coin; also, a denomination of money of
   account, formerly the unit of the Spanish monetary system.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: A real of plate (coin) varied in value according to the
         time of its coinage, from 121/2 down to 10 cents, or
         from 61/2 to 5 pence sterling. The real vellon, or
         money of account, was nearly equal to five cents, or
         21/2 pence sterling. In 1871 the coinage of Spain was
         assimilated to that of the Latin Union, of which the
         franc is the unit.
