      <WordDefinition>RESPONSIBILITY, n.  A detachable burden easily shifted to the
shoulders of God, Fate, Fortune, Luck or one's neighbor.  In the days
of astrology it was customary to unload it upon a star.

    Alas, things ain't what we should see
    If Eve had let that apple be;
    And many a feller which had ought
    To set with monarchses of thought,
    Or play some rosy little game
    With battle-chaps on fields of fame,
    Is downed by his unlucky star
    And hollers:  "Peanuts! -- here you are!"
                                                   "The Sturdy Beggar"
