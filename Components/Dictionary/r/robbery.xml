      <WordDefinition>Robbery
   Practised by the Ishmaelites (Gen. 16:12), the Chaldeans and
   Sabeans (Job 1:15, 17), and the men of Shechem (Judg. 9:25. See
   also 1 Sam. 27:6-10; 30; Hos. 4:2; 6:9). Robbers infested Judea
   in our Lord's time (Luke 10:30; John 18:40; Acts 5:36, 37;
   21:38; 2 Cor. 11:26). The words of the Authorized Version,
   "counted it not robbery to be equal," etc. (Phil. 2:6, 7), are
   better rendered in the Revised Version, "counted it not a prize
   to be on an equality," etc., i.e., "did not look upon equality
   with God as a prize which must not slip from his grasp" = "did
   not cling with avidity to the prerogatives of his divine
   majesty; did not ambitiously display his equality with God."
   
     "Robbers of churches" should be rendered, as in the Revised
   Version, "of temples." In the temple at Ephesus there was a
   great treasure-chamber, and as all that was laid up there was
   under the guardianship of the goddess Diana, to steal from such
   a place would be sacrilege (Acts 19:37).

      <WordDefinition>Robbery \Rob"ber*y\, n.; pl. {Robberies}. [OF. roberie.]
   1. The act or practice of robbing; theft.
      [1913 Webster]

            Thieves for their robbery have authority
            When judges steal themselves.         --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Law) The crime of robbing. See {Rob}, v. t., 2.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Robbery, in a strict sense, differs from theft, as it
         is effected by force or intimidation, whereas theft is
         committed by stealth, or privately.
         [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Theft; depredation; spoliation; despoliation;
        despoilment; plunder; pillage; rapine; larceny;
        freebooting; piracy.
        [1913 Webster]
