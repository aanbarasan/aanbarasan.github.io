      <WordDefinition>Reserve \Re*serve"\ (r?-z?rv"), v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Reserved}.
   (z?rvd");p. pr. &amp; vb. n. {Reserving}.] [F. r['e]server, L.
   reservare, reservatum; pref. re- re- + servare to keep. See
   {Serve}.]
   1. To keep back; to retain; not to deliver, make over, or
      disclose. ``I have reserved to myself nothing.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Hence, to keep in store for future or special use; to
      withhold from present use for another purpose or time; to
      keep; to retain; to make a reservation[7]. --Gen. xxvii.
      35.

   Note: In cases where one person or party makes a request to
         an agent that some accommodation (such as a hotel room
         or place at a restaurant) be kept (reserved) for their
         use at a particular time, the word reserve applies both
         to the action of the person making the request, and to
         the action of the agent who takes the approproriate
         action (such as a notation in a book of reservations)
         to be certain that the accommodation is available at
         that time.
         [1913 Webster +PJC]

               Hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, which I
               have reserved against the time of trouble? --Job

         [1913 Webster]
