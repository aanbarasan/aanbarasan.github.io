      <WordDefinition>RIDICULE, n.  Words designed to show that the person of whom they are
uttered is devoid of the dignity of character distinguishing him who
utters them.  It may be graphic, mimetic or merely rident. 
Shaftesbury is quoted as having pronounced it the test of truth -- a
ridiculous assertion, for many a solemn fallacy has undergone
centuries of ridicule with no abatement of its popular acceptance. 
What, for example, has been more valorously derided than the doctrine
of Infant Respectability?

      <WordDefinition>Ridicule \Rid"i*cule\, n. [F. ridicule, L. ridiculum a jest, fr.
   ridiculus. See {Ridiculous}.]
   1. An object of sport or laughter; a laughingstock; a
      laughing matter.
      [1913 Webster]

            [Marlborough] was so miserably ignorant, that his
            deficiencies made him the ridicule of his
            contemporaries.                       --Buckle.
      [1913 Webster]

            To the people . . . but a trifle, to the king but a
            ridicule.                             --Foxe.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Remarks concerning a subject or a person designed to
      excite laughter with a degree of contempt; wit of that
      species which provokes contemptuous laughter;
      disparagement by making a person an object of laughter;
      banter; -- a term lighter than derision.
      [1913 Webster]

            We have in great measure restricted the meaning of
            ridicule, which would properly extend over whole
            region of the ridiculous, -- the laughable, -- and
            we have narrowed it so that in common usage it
            mostly corresponds to ``derision'', which does
            indeed involve personal and offensive feelings.
                                                  --Hare.
      [1913 Webster]

            Safe from the bar, the pulpit, and the throne,
            Yet touched and shamed by ridicule alone. --Pope.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Quality of being ridiculous; ridiculousness. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

            To see the ridicule of this practice. --Addison.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Derision; banter; raillery; burlesque; mockery; irony;
        satire; sarcasm; gibe; jeer; sneer; ribbing.

   Usage: {Ridicule}, {Derision}, {mockery}, {ribbing}: All four
          words imply disapprobation; but ridicule and mockery
          may signify either good-natured opposition without
          manifest malice, or more maliciously, an attempt to
          humiliate. Derision is commonly bitter and scornful,
          and sometimes malignant. {ribbing} is almost always
          good-natured and fun-loving.
