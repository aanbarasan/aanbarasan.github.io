   (Heb. peninim), only in plural (Lam. 4:7). The ruby was one of
   the stones in the high priest's breastplate (Ex. 28:17). A
   comparison is made between the value of wisdom and rubies (Job
   28:18; Prov. 3:15; 8:11). The price of a virtuous woman is said
   to be "far above rubies" (Prov. 31:10). The exact meaning of the
   Hebrew word is uncertain. Some render it "red coral;" others,
   "pearl" or "mother-of-pearl."

        1. A {relational language} designed by Jones and M. Sheeran in
        1986 for describing and designing circuits (a {hardware
        description language}).  Ruby programs denote {binary
        relations} and programs are built-up inductively from
        primitive relations using a pre-defined set of {relational
        operators}.  Ruby programs also have a geometric
        interpretation as networks of primitive relations connected by
        wires, which is important when layout is considered in circuit
        design.
     
        Ruby has been continually developed since 1986, and has been
        used to design many different kinds of circuits, including
        {systolic arrays}, {butterfly networks} and arithmetic
        circuits.

        2. One of five pedagogical languages based on {Markov
        algorithms}, used in Higman's report (below).  The other
        languages are {Brilliant}, {Diamond}, {Nonpareil}, and
        {Pearl}.

        3. A fully {object oriented} {interpreted} {scripting
        language} by Yukihiro Matsumoto &lt;matz@netlab.co.jp&gt;.
     
        Similar in scope to {Perl} and {Python}, Ruby has high-level
        {data types}, automatic {memory management}, {dynamic typing},
        a {module} system, {exceptions}, and a rich standard library.
        Other features are {CLU}-style {iterators} for {loop
        abstraction}, {singleton classes}/{methods} and {lexical
        closures}.
     
        In Ruby, everything is an {object}, including the basic data
        types.  For example, the number 1 is an instance of {class}
        Fixnum.
