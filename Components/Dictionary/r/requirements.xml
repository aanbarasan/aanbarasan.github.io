      <WordDefinition>requirements
     
        &lt;programming&gt; The first stage of software development which
        defines what the potential users want the system to do.  In
        modern methods these requirements should be testable, and will
        usually be traceable in later development stages.  A common
        feature of nearly all software is that the requirements change
        during its lifetime.
     
        See {software life-cycle}.
