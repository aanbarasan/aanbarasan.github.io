      <WordDefinition>Roll
   the common form of ancient books. The Hebrew word rendered
   "roll" or "volume" is _meghillah_, found in Ezra 6:2; Ps. 40:7;
   Jer. 36:2, 6, 23, 28, 29; Ezek. 2:9; 3:1-3; Zech. 5:1, 2.
   "Rolls" (Chald. pl. of sephar, corresponding to Heb. sepher) in
   Ezra 6:1 is rendered in the Revised Version "archives." In the
   New Testament the word "volume" (Heb. 10:7; R.V., "roll") occurs
   as the rendering of the Greek kephalis, meaning the head or top
   of the stick or cylinder on which the manuscript was rolled, and
   hence the manuscript itself. (See {BOOK}.)
