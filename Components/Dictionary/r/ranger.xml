      <WordDefinition>Seal \Seal\ (s[=e]l), n. [OE. sele, AS. seolh; akin to OHG.
   selah, Dan. s[ae]l, Sw. sj["a]l, Icel. selr.] (Zo["o]l.)
   Any aquatic carnivorous mammal of the families {Phocid[ae]}
   and {Otariid[ae]}.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Seals inhabit seacoasts, and are found principally in
         the higher latitudes of both hemispheres. There are
         numerous species, bearing such popular names as {sea
         lion}, {sea leopard}, {sea bear}, or {ursine seal},
         {fur seal}, and {sea elephant}. The bearded seal
         ({Erignathus barbatus}), the hooded seal ({Cystophora
         cristata}), and the ringed seal ({Phoca f[oe]tida}),
         are northern species. See also {Eared seal}, {Harp
         seal}, {Monk seal}, and {Fur seal}, under {Eared},
         {Harp}, {Monk}, and {Fur}. Seals are much hunted for
         their skins and fur, and also for their oil, which in
         some species is very abundant.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Harbor seal} (Zo["o]l.), the common seal ({Phoca vitulina}).
      It inhabits both the North Atlantic and the North Pacific
      Ocean, and often ascends rivers; -- called also {marbled
      seal}, {native seal}, {river seal}, {bay seal}, {land
      seal}, {sea calf}, {sea cat}, {sea dog}, {dotard},
      {ranger}, {selchie}, {tangfish}.
