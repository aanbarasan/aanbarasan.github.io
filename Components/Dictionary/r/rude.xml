      <WordDefinition>rude
     
        [WPI] 1. Badly written or functionally poor, e.g. a program
        that is very difficult to use because of gratuitously poor
        design decisions.  Opposite: {cuspy}.
     
        2. Anything that manipulates a shared resource without regard
        for its other users in such a way as to cause a (non-fatal)
        problem.  Examples: programs that change tty modes without
        resetting them on exit, or windowing programs that keep
        forcing themselves to the top of the window stack.  Compare
        {all-elbows}.
