      <WordDefinition>repeater
     
        &lt;networking, communications&gt; A network or communications
        device which propagates electrical signals from one cable to
        another, amplifying them to restore them to full strength in
        the process.  Repeaters are used to counter the attenuation
        which occurs when signals travel long distances (e.g. across
        an ocean).
     
        A network repeater is less intelligent than a {bridge},
        {gateway} or {router} since it works at the {physical layer}.
