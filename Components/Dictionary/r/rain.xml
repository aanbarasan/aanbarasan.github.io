      <WordDefinition>Rain
   There are three Hebrew words used to denote the rains of
   different seasons, (1.) Yoreh (Hos. 6:3), or moreh (Joel 2:23),
   denoting the former or the early rain. (2.) Melqosh, the "latter
   rain" (Prov. 16:15). (3.) Geshem, the winter rain, "the rains."
   The heavy winter rain is mentioned in Gen. 7:12; Ezra 10:9;
   Cant. 2:11. The "early" or "former" rains commence in autumn in
   the latter part of October or beginning of November (Deut.
   11:14; Joel 2:23; comp. Jer. 3:3), and continue to fall heavily
   for two months. Then the heavy "winter rains" fall from the
   middle of December to March. There is no prolonged fair weather
   in Palestine between October and March. The "latter" or spring
   rains fall in March and April, and serve to swell the grain then
   coming to maturity (Deut. 11:14; Hos. 6:3). After this there is
   ordinarily no rain, the sky being bright and cloudless till
   October or November.
   
     Rain is referred to symbolically in Deut. 32:2; Ps. 72:6; Isa.
   44:3, 4; Hos. 10:12.

      <WordDefinition>Rain \Rain\ (r[=a]n), n. [OE. rein, AS. regen; akin to OFries.
   rein, D. &amp; G. regen, OS. &amp; OHG. regan, Icel., Dan., &amp; Sw.
   regn, Goth. rign, and prob. to L. rigare to water, to wet;
   cf. Gr. bre`chein to wet, to rain.]
   Water falling in drops from the clouds; the descent of water
   from the clouds in drops.
   [1913 Webster]

         Rain is water by the heat of the sun divided into very
         small parts ascending in the air, till, encountering
         the cold, it be condensed into clouds, and descends in
         drops.                                   --Ray.
   [1913 Webster]

         Fair days have oft contracted wind and rain. --Milton.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Rain is distinguished from mist by the size of the
         drops, which are distinctly visible. When water falls
         in very small drops or particles, it is called mist;
         and fog is composed of particles so fine as to be not
         only individually indistinguishable, but to float or be
         suspended in the air. See {Fog}, and {Mist}.
