   Introduction Russia
   -------------------
                            Background: The defeat of the Russian Empire in
                                        World War I led to the seizure of
                                        power by the Communists and the
                                        formation of the USSR. The brutal
                                        rule of Josef STALIN (1924-53)
                                        strengthened Russian dominance of
                                        the Soviet Union at a cost of tens
                                        of millions of lives. The Soviet
                                        economy and society stagnated in the
                                        following decades until General
                                        Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV (1985-
                                        91) introduced glasnost (openness)
                                        and perestroika (restructuring) in
                                        an attempt to modernize Communism,
                                        but his initiatives inadvertently
                                        released forces that by December
                                        1991 splintered the USSR into 15
                                        independent republics. Since then,
                                        Russia has struggled in its efforts
                                        to build a democratic political
                                        system and market economy to replace
                                        the strict social, political, and
                                        economic controls of the Communist
                                        period. A determined guerrilla
                                        conflict still plagues Russia in
                                        Chechnya.

   Economy Russia
   --------------
                    Economy - overview: A decade after the implosion of the
                                        Soviet Union in December 1991,
                                        Russia is still struggling to
                                        establish a modern market economy
                                        and achieve strong economic growth.
                                        In contrast to its trading partners
                                        in Central Europe - which were able
                                        to overcome the initial production
                                        declines that accompanied the launch
                                        of market reforms within three to
                                        five years - Russia saw its economy
                                        contract for five years, as the
                                        executive and legislature dithered
                                        over the implementation of many of
                                        the basic foundations of a market
                                        economy. Russia achieved a slight
                                        recovery in 1997, but the
                                        government's stubborn budget
                                        deficits and the country's poor
                                        business climate made it vulnerable
                                        when the global financial crisis
                                        swept through in 1998. The crisis
                                        culminated in the August
                                        depreciation of the ruble, a debt
                                        default by the government, and a
                                        sharp deterioration in living
                                        standards for most of the
                                        population. The economy subsequently
                                        has rebounded, growing by an average
                                        of more than 6% annually in 1999-
                                        2001 on the back of higher oil
                                        prices and a weak ruble. This
                                        recovery, along with a renewed
                                        government effort in 2000 and 2001
                                        to advance lagging structural
                                        reforms, have raised business and
                                        investor confidence over Russia's
                                        prospects in its second decade of
                                        transition. Yet serious problems
                                        persist. Russia remains heavily
                                        dependent on exports of commodities,
                                        particularly oil, natural gas,
                                        metals, and timber, which account
                                        for over 80% of exports, leaving the
                                        country vulnerable to swings in
                                        world prices. Russia's industrial
                                        base is increasingly dilapidated and
                                        must be replaced or modernized if
                                        the country is to achieve
                                        sustainable economic growth. Other
                                        problems include widespread

                                        island on the Argun; Russia hastens
                                        to delimit and demarcate boundary
                                        with Kazakhstan to limit illegal
                                        border activities; in 2002, Russia
                                        is the first state to submit data to
                                        the UN Commission on the Limits of

                                        continental shelf by claiming two
                                        undersea ridges in the Arctic;
                                        Russia signed bilateral agreements

                                        delimiting the Caspian seabed, but
                                        littoral states are far from
                                        multilateral agreement on dividing
                                        the waters and seabed regimes - Iran

                                        into five equal sectors while
                                        Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and
                                        Turkmenistan have generally agreed
                                        upon equidistant seabed boundaries;
                                        despite recent discussions, Russia
                                        and Norway dispute their maritime
                                        limits in the Barents Sea and

                                        Ukraine have successfully delimited
                                        land boundary in 2001, but disagree
                                        on delimitation of maritime boundary
