   Syn: Drive.

   Usage: {Ride}, {Drive}. Ride originally meant (and is so used
          throughout the English Bible) to be carried on
          horseback or in a vehicle of any kind. At present in
          England, drive is the word applied in most cases to
          progress in a carriage; as, a drive around the park,
          etc.; while ride is appropriated to progress on a
          horse. Johnson seems to sanction this distinction by
          giving ``to travel on horseback'' as the leading sense
          of ride; though he adds ``to travel in a vehicle'' as
          a secondary sense. This latter use of the word still
          occurs to some extent; as, the queen rides to
          Parliament in her coach of state; to ride in an
          omnibus.
          [1913 Webster]

                ``Will you ride over or drive?'' said Lord
                Willowby to his quest, after breakfast that
                morning.                          --W. Black.
