      <WordDefinition>radon
Symbol: Rn
Atomic number: 86
Atomic weight: (222)
Colorless radioactive gaseous element, belongs to the noble gases. Of the
twenty known isotopes, the most stable is Rn-222 with a half-life of 3.8 days.
Formed by the radioactive decay of {Radium}-226. Radon itself decays into
{polonium}. Used in radiotherapy. As a noble gas, it is effectively inert,
though radon fluoride has been synthesized. First isolated in 1908 by Ramsey
and Gray.

         compounds; as, noble-born, noble-hearted, noble-minded.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Noble gas} (Chem.), a gaseous element belonging to group
      VIII of the periodic table of elements, not combining with
      other elements under normal reaction conditions;
      specifically, {helium}, {neon}, {argon}, {krypton},
      {xenon}, or {radon}; also called {inert gas}.

   {Noble metals} (Chem.), silver, gold, and platinum; -- so
      called from their resistance to oxidation by air and to
      dissolution by acids. Copper, mercury, aluminium,
      palladium, rhodium, iridium, and osmium are sometimes
      included.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Honorable; worthy; dignified; elevated; exalted;
        superior; sublime; great; eminent; illustrious;

      <WordDefinition>Radon \Ra"don\ (r[=a]"d[o^]n), n. (Chem.)
   An intensely radioactive gaseous element produced by the
   radioactive decay of radium-226, which is the main isotope of
   radium found in pitchblende. Chemically it is an inert noble
   gas. Its atomic symbol is Rn. It has an atomic number of 86.
   The radon isotope produced by decay of radium has an atomic
   weight of 222.017, and this isotope decays by alpha emission
   with a half-life of 3.82 days. Numerous other isotopes have
   been observed, all radioactive and all having half-lives
   shorter than that of radon-222. Radon was discovered by M.
   and Mme. Curie, of Paris, in their studies of the radioactive
   substances in pitchblende. Radon was originally called
   {radium emanation} or {exradio}.

      <WordDefinition>radon
     n : a radioactive gaseous element formed by the disintegration
         of radium; the heaviest of the inert gasses; occurs
         naturally (especially in areas over granite) and is
         considered a hazard to health [syn: {Rn}, {atomic number
         86}]
