      <WordDefinition>Rose
   Many varieties of the rose proper are indigenous to Syria. The
   famed rose of Damascus is white, but there are also red and
   yellow roses. In Cant. 2:1 and Isa. 35:1 the Hebrew word
   _habatstseleth_ (found only in these passages), rendered "rose"
   (R.V. marg., "autumn crocus"), is supposed by some to mean the
   oleander, by others the sweet-scented narcissus (a native of
   Palestine), the tulip, or the daisy; but nothing definite can be
   affirmed regarding it.
   
     The "rose of Sharon" is probably the cistus or rock-rose,
   several species of which abound in Palestine. "Mount Carmel
   especially abounds in the cistus, which in April covers some of
   the barer parts of the mountain with a glow not inferior to that
   of the Scottish heather." (See {MYRRH} [2].)

          undesirable, because rise sufficiently expresses the
          idea, and appreciate has its own distinctive meaning,
          which ought not to be confused with one so entirely
          different.

      <WordDefinition>Rose \Rose\, n. [AS. rose, L. rosa, probably akin to Gr. ?,

         distinct classes of roses have been formed, as the
         Banksia, Baurbon, Boursalt, China, Noisette, hybrid
         perpetual, etc., with multitudes of varieties in nearly
