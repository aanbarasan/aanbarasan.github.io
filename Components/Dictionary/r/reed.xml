      <WordDefinition>Reed
   (1.) "Paper reeds" (Isa. 19:7; R.V., "reeds"). Heb. 'aroth,
   properly green herbage growing in marshy places.
   
     (2.) Heb. kaneh (1 Kings 14:15; Job 40:21; Isa. 19:6), whence
   the Gr. kanna, a "cane," a generic name for a reed of any kind.
   
     The reed of Egypt and Palestine is the Arundo donax, which
   grows to the height of 12 feet, its stalk jointed like the
   bamboo, "with a magnificent panicle of blossom at the top, and
   so slender and yielding that it will lie perfectly flat under a
   gust of wind, and immediately resume its upright position." It
   is used to illustrate weakness (2 Kings 18:21; Ezek. 29:6), also
   fickleness or instability (Matt. 11:7; comp. Eph. 4:14).
   
     A "bruised reed" (Isa. 42:3; Matt. 12:20) is an emblem of a
   believer weak in grace. A reed was put into our Lord's hands in
   derision (Matt. 27:29); and "they took the reed and smote him on
   the head" (30). The "reed" on which they put the sponge filled
   with vinegar (Matt. 27:48) was, according to John (19:29), a
   hyssop stalk, which must have been of some length, or perhaps a
   bunch of hyssop twigs fastened to a rod with the sponge. (See {CANE}.)
