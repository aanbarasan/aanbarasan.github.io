        1. One of a small number of high-speed memory locations in a
        computer's {CPU}.  Registers differ from ordinary
        {random access memory} in several respects:
     
        There are only a small number of registers (the "register
        set"), typically 32 in a modern processor though some,
        e.g. {SPARC}, have as many as 144.  A register may be directly
        addressed with a few bits.  In contrast, there are usually
        millions of words of main memory (RAM), requiring at least
        twenty bits to specify a memory location.  Main memory
        locations are often specified indirectly, using an {indirect
        addressing} mode where the actual memory address is held in a
        register.
     
        Registers are fast; typically, two registers can be read and a
        third written -- all in a single cycle.  Memory is slower; a
        single access can require several cycles.
     
        The limited size and high speed of the register set makes it
        one of the critical resources in most computer architectures.
        {Register allocation}, typically one phase of the {back-end},
        controls the use of registers by a compiled program.
     
        See also {accumulator}, {FUBAR}, {orthogonal}, {register
        dancing}, {register allocation}, {register spilling}.
     
        2. An addressable location in a {memory-mapped} peripheral
        device.  E.g. the transmit data register in a {UART}.
