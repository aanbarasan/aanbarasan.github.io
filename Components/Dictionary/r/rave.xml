      <WordDefinition>rave
     
        [WPI] 1. To persist in discussing a specific subject.
     
        2. To speak authoritatively on a subject about which one knows
        very little.
     
        3. To complain to a person who is not in a position to correct
        the difficulty.
     
        4. To purposely annoy another person verbally.
     
        5. To evangelise.  See {flame}.
     
        6. Also used to describe a less negative form of blather, such
        as friendly bullshitting.  "Rave" differs slightly from
        {flame} in that "rave" implies that it is the persistence or
        obliviousness of the person speaking that is annoying, while
        {flame} implies somewhat more strongly that the tone or
        content is offensive as well.
