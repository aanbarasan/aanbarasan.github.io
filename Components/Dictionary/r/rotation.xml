      <WordDefinition>Rotation \Ro*ta"tion\, n. [L. rotatio: cf. F. rotation.]
   1. The act of turning, as a wheel or a solid body on its
      axis, as distinguished from the progressive motion of a
      revolving round another body or a distant point; thus, the
      daily turning of the earth on its axis is a rotation; its
      annual motion round the sun is a revolution.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Any return or succesion in a series.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Moment of rotation}. See {Moment of inertia}, under
      {Moment}.

   {Rotation in office}, the practice of changing public
      officers at frequent intervals by discharges and
      substitutions.

   {Rotation of crops}, the practices of cultivating an orderly
      succession of different crops on the same land.
