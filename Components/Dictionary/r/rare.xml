   Syn: Scarce; infrequent; unusual; uncommon; singular;
        extraordinary; incomparable.

   Usage: {Rare}, {Scarce}. We call a thing rare when but few
          examples, specimens, or instances of it are ever to be
          met with; as, a rare plant. We speak of a thing as
          scarce, which, though usually abundant, is for the
          time being to be had only in diminished quantities;
          as, a bad harvest makes corn scarce.
          [1913 Webster]
