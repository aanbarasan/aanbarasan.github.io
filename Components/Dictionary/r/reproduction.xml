      <WordDefinition>Reproduction \Re`pro*duc"tion\ (-d?k"sh?n), n. [Cf. F.
   reproduction.]
   1. The act or process of reproducing; the state of being
      reproduced; specifically (Biol.), the process by which
      plants and animals give rise to offspring.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: There are two distinct methods of reproduction; viz.:
         {asexual reproduction} (agamogenesis) and {sexual
         reproduction} (gamogenesis). In both cases the new
         individual is developed from detached portions of the
         parent organism. In asexual reproduction (gemmation,
         fission, etc.), the detached portions of the organism
         develop into new individuals without the intervention
         of other living matter. In sexual reproduction, the
         detached portion, which is always a single cell, called
         the female germ cell, is acted upon by another portion
         of living matter, the male germ cell, usually from
         another organism, and in the fusion of the two
         (impregnation) a new cell is formed, from the
         development of which arises a new individual.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. That which is reproduced.
      [1913 Webster]
