      <WordDefinition>Resist \Re*sist"\, n.
   1. (Calico Printing) A substance used to prevent a color or
      mordant from fixing on those parts to which it has been
      applied, either by acting machanically in preventing the
      color, etc., from reaching the cloth, or chemically in
      changing the color so as to render it incapable of fixing
      itself in the fibers; -- also called {reserve}. The pastes
      prepared for this purpose are called resist pastes. --F.
      C. Calvert.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Technology) Something that resists or prevents a certain
      action; specif.: A substance applied to a surface, as of
      metal, or of a silicon wafer, to prevent the action on it
      of acid, other chemical agents, or any other process such
      as irradiation or deposition, which would modify the
      surface if not protected. The resist is usually applied or
      in some way formed into a pattern so that the underlying
      surface may be modified in a complementary pattern.
