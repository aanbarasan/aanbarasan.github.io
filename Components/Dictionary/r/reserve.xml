      <WordDefinition>Reserve \Re*serve"\, n. [F. r['e]serve.]
   1. The act of reserving, or keeping back; reservation.
      [1913 Webster]

            However any one may concur in the general scheme, it
            is still with certain reserves and deviations.
                                                  --Addison.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. That which is reserved, or kept back, as for future use.
      [1913 Webster]

            The virgins, besides the oil in their lamps, carried
            likewise a reserve in some other vessel for a
            continual supply.                     --Tillotson.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. That which is excepted; exception.
      [1913 Webster]

            Each has some darling lust, which pleads for a
            reserve.                              --Rogers.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. Restraint of freedom in words or actions; backwardness;
      caution in personal behavior.
      [1913 Webster]

            My soul, surprised, and from her sex disjoined,
            Left all reserve, and all the sex, behind. --Prior.
      [1913 Webster]

            The clergyman's shy and sensitive reserve had balked
            this scheme.                          --Hawthorne.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. A tract of land reserved, or set apart, for a particular
      purpose; as, the Connecticut Reserve in Ohio, originally
      set apart for the school fund of Connecticut; the Clergy
      Reserves in Canada, for the support of the clergy.
      [1913 Webster]

   6. (Mil.)
      (a) A body of troops in the rear of an army drawn up for
          battle, reserved to support the other lines as
          occasion may require; a force or body of troops kept
          for an exigency.
      (b) troops trained but released from active service,
          retained as a formal part of the military force, and
          liable to be recalled to active service in cases of
          national need (see {Army organization}, above).
          [1913 Webster +PJC]

   7. (Banking) Funds kept on hand to meet liabilities.
      [1913 Webster]

   8. (Finance)
      (a) That part of the assets of a bank or other financial
          institution specially kept in cash in a more or less
          liquid form as a reasonable provision for meeting all
          demands which may be made upon it; specif.:
      (b) (Banking) Usually, the uninvested cash kept on hand
          for this purpose, called the {real reserve}. In Great
          Britain the ultimate real reserve is the gold kept on
          hand in the Bank of England, largely represented by
          the notes in hand in its own banking department; and
          any balance which a bank has with the Bank of England
          is a part of its reserve. In the United States the
          reserve of a national bank consists of the amount of
          lawful money it holds on hand against deposits, which
          is required by law (in 1913) to be not less than 15
          per cent (--U. S. Rev. Stat. secs. 5191, 5192), three
          fifths of which the banks not in a reserve city (which
          see) may keep deposited as balances in national banks
          that are in reserve cities (--U. S. Rev. Stat. sec.
          5192).
      (c) (Life Insurance) The amount of funds or assets
          necessary for a company to have at any given time to
          enable it, with interest and premiums paid as they
          shall accure, to meet all claims on the insurance then
          in force as they would mature according to the
          particular mortality table accepted. The reserve is
          always reckoned as a liability, and is calculated on
          net premiums. It is theoretically the difference
          between the present value of the total insurance and
          the present value of the future premiums on the
          insurance. The reserve, being an amount for which
          another company could, theoretically, afford to take
          over the insurance, is sometimes called the

   {reinsurance fund} or the

   {self-insurance fund}. For the first year upon any policy the
      net premium is called the

   {initial reserve}, and the balance left at the end of the
      year including interest is the

   {terminal reserve}. For subsequent years the initial reserve
      is the net premium, if any, plus the terminal reserve of
      the previous year. The portion of the reserve to be
      absorbed from the initial reserve in any year in payment
      of losses is sometimes called the

   {insurance reserve}, and the terminal reserve is then called
      the

   {investment reserve}.
      [Webster 1913 Suppl.]

   9. In exhibitions, a distinction which indicates that the
      recipient will get a prize if another should be
      disqualified.
      [Webster 1913 Suppl.]

   10. (Calico Printing) A resist.
       [Webster 1913 Suppl.]

   11. A preparation used on an object being electroplated to
       fix the limits of the deposit.
       [Webster 1913 Suppl.]

      <WordDefinition>Reserve \Re*serve"\ (r?-z?rv"), v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Reserved}.
   (z?rvd");p. pr. &amp; vb. n. {Reserving}.] [F. r['e]server, L.
   reservare, reservatum; pref. re- re- + servare to keep. See
   {Serve}.]

   Note: In cases where one person or party makes a request to
         an agent that some accommodation (such as a hotel room
         or place at a restaurant) be kept (reserved) for their
         use at a particular time, the word reserve applies both
         to the action of the person making the request, and to
         the action of the agent who takes the approproriate
         action (such as a notation in a book of reservations)
         to be certain that the accommodation is available at
         that time.
         [1913 Webster +PJC]

               Hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, which I
               have reserved against the time of trouble? --Job
                                                  xxxviii.
                                                  22,23.
         [1913 Webster]

               Reserve your kind looks and language for private
               hours.                             --Swift.

      <WordDefinition>Resist \Re*sist"\, n.
   1. (Calico Printing) A substance used to prevent a color or
      mordant from fixing on those parts to which it has been
      applied, either by acting machanically in preventing the
      color, etc., from reaching the cloth, or chemically in
      changing the color so as to render it incapable of fixing
      itself in the fibers; -- also called {reserve}. The pastes
      prepared for this purpose are called resist pastes. --F.
      C. Calvert.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Technology) Something that resists or prevents a certain
      action; specif.: A substance applied to a surface, as of
      metal, or of a silicon wafer, to prevent the action on it
      of acid, other chemical agents, or any other process such
      as irradiation or deposition, which would modify the
      surface if not protected. The resist is usually applied or
      in some way formed into a pattern so that the underlying
      surface may be modified in a complementary pattern.
