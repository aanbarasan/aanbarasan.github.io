      <WordDefinition>ROPE, n.  An obsolescent appliance for reminding assassins that they
too are mortal.  It is put about the neck and remains in place one's
whole life long.  It has been largely superseded by a more complex
electrical device worn upon another part of the person; and this is
rapidly giving place to an apparatus known as the preachment.
