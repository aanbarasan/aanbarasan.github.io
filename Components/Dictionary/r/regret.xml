      <WordDefinition>Regret \Re*gret"\ (r?*gr?t"), n. [F., fr. regretter. See
   {Regret}, v.]
   1. Pain of mind on account of something done or experienced
      in the past, with a wish that it had been different; a
      looking back with dissatisfaction or with longing; grief;
      sorrow; especially, a mourning on account of the loss of
      some joy, advantage, or satisfaction. ``A passionate
      regret at sin.'' --Dr. H. More.
      [1913 Webster]

            What man does not remember with regret the first
            time he read Robinson Crusoe?         --Macaulay.
      [1913 Webster]

            Never any prince expressed a more lively regret for
            the loss of a servant. --Clarendon.
      [1913 Webster]

            From its peaceful bosom [the grave] spring none but
            fond regrets and tender recollections. --W. Irving.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Dislike; aversion. [Obs.] --Dr. H. More.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Grief; concern; sorrow; lamentation; repentance;
        penitence; self-condemnation.

   Usage: {Regret}, {Remorse}, {Compunction}, {Contrition},
          {Repentance}. Regret does not carry with it the energy
          of remorse, the sting of compunction, the sacredness
          of contrition, or the practical character of
          repentance. We even apply the term regret to
          circumstance over which we have had no control, as the
          absence of friends or their loss. When connected with
          ourselves, it relates rather to unwise acts than to
          wrong or sinful ones. --C. J. Smith.
