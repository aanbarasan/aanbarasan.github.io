      <WordDefinition>Reins
   the kidneys, the supposed seat of the desires and affections;
   used metaphorically for "heart." The "reins" and the "heart" are
   often mentioned together, as denoting the whole moral
   constitution of man (Ps. 7:9; 16:7; 26:2; 139:13; Jer. 17:10,
   etc.).

      called because formerly supposed to have their seat in the

            My reins rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.
                                                  --Prov. xxiii.
                                                  16.

                                                  ii. 23.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Reins of a vault} (Arch.), the parts between the crown and
      the spring or abutment, including, and having especial
      reference to, the loading or filling behind the shell of
      the vault. The reins are to a vault nearly what the
      haunches are to an arch, and when a vault gives way by
      thrusting outward, it is because its reins are not
      sufficiently filled up.
      [1913 Webster]
