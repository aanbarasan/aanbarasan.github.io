   Introduction Reunion
   --------------------
                            Background: The Portuguese discovered the
                                        uninhabited island in 1513. From the
                                        17th to the 19th centuries, French
                                        immigration supplemented by influxes
                                        of Africans, Chinese, Malays, and
                                        Malabar Indians gave the island its
                                        ethnic mix. The opening of the Suez
                                        Canal in 1869 cost the island its
                                        importance as a stopover on the East
                                        Indies trade route.

   Economy Reunion
   ---------------
                    Economy - overview: The economy has traditionally been
                                        based on agriculture. Sugarcane has
                                        been the primary crop for more than
                                        a century, and in some years it
                                        accounts for 85% of exports. The
                                        government has been pushing the
                                        development of a tourist industry to
                                        relieve high unemployment, which
                                        amounts to more than 40% of the
                                        labor force. The gap in Reunion
                                        between the well-off and the poor is
                                        extraordinary and accounts for the
                                        persistent social tensions. The
                                        white and Indian communities are
                                        substantially better off than other
                                        segments of the population, often
                                        approaching European standards,
                                        whereas minority groups suffer the
                                        poverty and unemployment typical of
                                        the poorer nations of the African
                                        continent. The outbreak of severe
                                        rioting in February 1991 illustrates
                                        the seriousness of socioeconomic
                                        tensions. The economic well-being of
                                        Reunion depends heavily on continued
                                        financial assistance from France.
