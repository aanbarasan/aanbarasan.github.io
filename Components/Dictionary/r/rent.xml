   4. (Polit. Econ.)
      (a) That portion of the produce of the earth paid to the

          indestructible powers of the soil;'' the excess of the
          return from a given piece of cultivated land over that
          from land of equal area at the ``margin of
          cultivation.'' Called also {economic rent}, or
          {Ricardian rent}. Economic rent is due partly to
          differences of productivity, but chiefly to advantages
          of location; it is equivalent to ordinary or
          commercial rent less interest on improvements, and
          nearly equivalent to ground rent.
      (b) Loosely, a return or profit from a differential
          advantage for production, as in case of income or
          earnings due to rare natural gifts creating a natural

      payment of it. --Bouvier.
