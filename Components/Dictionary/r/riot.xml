      <WordDefinition>RIOT, n.  A popular entertainment given to the military by innocent
bystanders.

R.I.P.  A careless abbreviation of _requiescat in pace_, attesting to
indolent goodwill to the dead.  According to the learned Dr. Drigge,
however, the letters originally meant nothing more than _reductus in
pulvis_.
