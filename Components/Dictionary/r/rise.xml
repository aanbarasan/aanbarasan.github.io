   Usage: {Rise}, {Appreciate}. Some in America use the word

          appreciate, money appreciates, etc. This use is not
          unknown in England, but it is less common there. It is
          undesirable, because rise sufficiently expresses the
          idea, and appreciate has its own distinctive meaning,
          which ought not to be confused with one so entirely
          different.
