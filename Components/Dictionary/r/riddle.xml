      <WordDefinition>Riddle
   (Heb. hodah). The oldest and, strictly speaking, the only
   example of a riddle was that propounded by Samson (Judg.
   14:12-18). The parabolic prophecy in Ezek. 17:2-18 is there
   called a "riddle." It was rather, however, an allegory. The word
   "darkly" in 1 Cor. 13:12 is the rendering of the Greek enigma;
   marg., "in a riddle."
