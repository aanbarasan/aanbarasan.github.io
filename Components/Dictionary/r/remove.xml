      <WordDefinition>Remove \Re*move"\ (r?-m??v"), v. i.
   To change place in any manner, or to make a change in place;
   to move or go from one residence, position, or place to
   another.
   [1913 Webster]

         Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
         I can not taint with fear.               --Shak.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The verb remove, in some of its application, is
         synonymous with move, but not in all. Thus we do not
         apply remove to a mere change of posture, without a
         change of place or the seat of a thing. A man moves his
         head when he turns it, or his finger when he bends it,
         but he does not remove it. Remove usually or always
         denotes a change of place in a body, but we never apply
         it to a regular, continued course or motion. We never
         say the wind or water, or a ship, removes at a certain
         rate by the hour; but we say a ship was removed from
         one place in a harbor to another. Move is a generic
         term, including the sense of remove, which is more
         generally applied to a change from one station or
         permanent position, stand, or seat, to another station.
