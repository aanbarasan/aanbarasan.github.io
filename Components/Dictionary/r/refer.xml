      <WordDefinition>Refer \Re*fer"\, v. i.
   1. To have recourse; to apply; to appeal; to betake one's
      self; as, to refer to a dictionary.

            trust.                                --Bacon.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. To have relation or reference; to relate; to point; as,
      the figure refers to a footnote.

                                                  --Bp. Burnet.
      [1913 Webster]

      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: To allude; advert; suggest; appeal.

   Usage: {Refer}, {Allude}, {Advert}. We refer to a thing by
          specifically and distinctly introducing it into our
          discourse. We allude to it by introducing it
          indirectly or indefinitely, as by something
          collaterally allied to it. We advert to it by turning
          off somewhat abruptly to consider it more at large.
          Thus, Macaulay refers to the early condition of
          England at the opening of his history; he alludes to
          these statements from time to time; and adverts, in
          the progress of his work, to various circumstances of
          peculiar interest, on which for a time he dwells.
          ``But to do good is . . . that that Solomon chiefly
          refers to in the text.'' --Sharp. ``This, I doubt not,
          was that artificial structure here alluded to.'' --T.
          Burnet.
          [1913 Webster]

                Now to the universal whole advert:
                The earth regard as of that whole a part.
                                                  --Blackmore.
