      <WordDefinition>Raspberry \Rasp"ber*ry\ (r[a^]z"b[e^]r*r[y^]; 277), n. [From E.
   rasp, in allusion to the apparent roughness of the fruit.]
   (Bot.)
   (a) The thimble-shaped fruit of the {Rubus Id[ae]us} and
       other similar brambles; as, the black, the red, and the
       white raspberry.
   (b) The shrub bearing this fruit.
       [1913 Webster]

   Note: Technically, raspberries are those brambles in which
         the fruit separates readily from the core or
         receptacle, in this differing from the blackberries, in
         which the fruit is firmly attached to the receptacle.
         [1913 Webster]
