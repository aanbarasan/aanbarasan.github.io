      <WordDefinition>queue
     
        &lt;programming&gt; A {first-in first-out} data structure used to
        sequence multiple demands for a resource such as a {printer},
        {processor} or communications channel.  Objects are added to
        the tail of the queue and taken off the head.
     
        A typical use of queues in an {operating system} involves a
        user command which places something on a queue, e.g. a file on
        a printer queue or a job on a job queue, and a {background}
        process or "{demon}" which takes things off and processes them
        (e.g. prints or executes them).  Another common use is to pass
        data between an {interrupt handler} and a user process.
