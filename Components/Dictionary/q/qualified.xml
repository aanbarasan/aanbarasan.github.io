   {Qualified negative} (Legislation), a limited veto power, by
      which the chief executive in a constitutional government
      may refuse assent to bills passed by the legislative body,

      certain majority specified in the constitution, when they
      become laws without the approval of the executive.

          qualified with respect to specific acquirements and
