      <WordDefinition>QUIVER, n.  A portable sheath in which the ancient statesman and the
aboriginal lawyer carried their lighter arguments.

    He extracted from his quiver,
        Did the controversial Roman,
    An argument well fitted
    To the question as submitted,
    Then addressed it to the liver,
        Of the unpersuaded foeman.

      <WordDefinition>Quiver
   the sheath for arrows. The Hebrew word (aspah) thus commonly
   rendered is found in Job 39:23; Ps. 127:5; Isa. 22:6; 49:2; Jer.
   5:16; Lam. 3:13. In Gen. 27:3 this word is the rendering of the
   Hebrew _teli_, which is supposed rather to mean a suspended
   weapon, literally "that which hangs from one", i.e., is
   suspended from the shoulder or girdle.
