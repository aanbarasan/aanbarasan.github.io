   a Dublin playhouse, laid a wager that a new word of no
   meaning should be the common talk and puzzle of the city in
   twenty-four hours. In consequence of this the letters q u i z
   were chalked by him on all the walls of Dublin, with an
   effect that won the wager. Perhaps, however, originally a
   variant of whiz, and formerly the name of a popular game.]
