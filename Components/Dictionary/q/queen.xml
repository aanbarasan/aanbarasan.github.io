      <WordDefinition>Queen
   No explicit mention of queens is made till we read of the "queen
   of Sheba." The wives of the kings of Israel are not so
   designated. In Ps. 45:9, the Hebrew for "queen" is not _malkah_,
   one actually ruling like the Queen of Sheba, but _shegal_, which
   simply means the king's wife. In 1 Kings 11:19, Pharaoh's wife
   is called "the queen," but the Hebrew word so rendered (g'birah)
   is simply a title of honour, denoting a royal lady, used
   sometimes for "queen-mother" (1 Kings 15:13; 2 Chron. 15:16). In
   Cant. 6:8, 9, the king's wives are styled "queens" (Heb.
   melakhoth).
   
     In the New Testament we read of the "queen of the south",
   i.e., Southern Arabia, Sheba (Matt. 12:42; Luke 11:31) and the
   "queen of the Ethiopians" (Acts 8:27), Candace.
