      <WordDefinition>Q
     
        &lt;language&gt; A very {high level language} by Per Bothner based
        on {lazy} generalised sequences.  Q has {lexical scope}, and
        some support for {logic programming}[?] and {constraint}
        programming.  The language includes small subsets of {Common
        Lisp} and {Scheme}.
     
        Q was a test-bed for programming language ideas.  Where {APL}
        uses {arrays} for looping, Q uses generalised sequences which
        may be infinite and may be stored or calculated on demand.  It
        has {macros}, {primitives} to run programs, and an
        {interactive} command language.
     
        Q is implemented in {C++}, and comes with an {interpreter},
        {compiler} framework, libraries, and documentation.  It runs
        on {Linux} and {SUN-4} and should work on any 32-bit {Unix}.

      <WordDefinition>Q \Q\ (k[=u]),
   the seventeenth letter of the English alphabet, has but one
   sound (that of k), and is always followed by u, the two
   letters together being sounded like kw, except in some words
   in which the u is silent. See Guide to Pronunciation, [sect]
   249. Q is not found in Anglo-Saxon, cw being used instead of
   qu; as in cwic, quick; cwen, queen. The name (k[=u]) is from
   the French ku, which is from the Latin name of the same
   letter; its form is from the Latin, which derived it, through
   a Greek alphabet, from the Ph[oe]nician, the ultimate origin
   being Egyptian.
   [1913 Webster] Etymologically, q or qu is most nearly related
   to a (ch, tch), p, q, and wh; as in cud, quid, L. equus,
   ecus, horse, Gr. ?, whence E. equine, hippic; L. quod which,
   E. what; L. aquila, E. eaqle; E. kitchen, OE. kichene, AS.
   cycene, L. coquina.
