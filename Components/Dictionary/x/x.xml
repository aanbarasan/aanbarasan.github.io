        1. &lt;convention&gt; Used in various speech and writing contexts
        (also in lowercase) in roughly its algebraic sense of "unknown
        within a set defined by context" (compare {N}).  Thus, the
        abbreviation {680x0} stands for 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030 or
        68040, and {80x86} stands for {Intel 80186}, {Intel 80286},
        {Intel 80386} or {Intel 80486}.  A {Unix} hacker might write
        these as 680[0-4]0 and 80[1-4]86 or 680?0 and 80?86
        respectively; see {glob}.
     
        2. &lt;graphics&gt; An alternative name for the {X Window System}.
     
        3. &lt;storage&gt; A suffix for the speed of a {CD-ROM} drive
        relative to standard music CDs (1x).  32x is common in
        September 1999.

      <WordDefinition>X \X\ ([e^]ks).
   X, the twenty-fourth letter of the English alphabet, has
   three sounds; a compound nonvocal sound (that of ks), as in
   wax; a compound vocal sound (that of gz), as in example; and,
   at the beginning of a word, a simple vocal sound (that of z),
   as in xanthic. See Guide to Pronunciation, [sect][sect] 217,
   270, 271.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The form and value of X are from the Latin X, which is
         from the Greek [Chi], which in some Greek alphabets had
         the value of ks, though in the one now in common use it
         represents an aspirated sound of k.
