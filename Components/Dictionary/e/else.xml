      <WordDefinition>Else \Else\, adv. &amp; conj.
   1. Besides; except that mentioned; in addition; as, nowhere
      else; no one else.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Otherwise; in the other, or the contrary, case; if the
      facts were different.
      [1913 Webster]

            For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give
            it.                                   --Ps. li. 16.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: After `or', else is sometimes used expletively, as
         simply noting an alternative. ``Will you give thanks, .
         . . or else shall I?'' --Shak.

      <WordDefinition>Else \Else\, a. &amp; pron. [OE. &amp; AS. elles otherwise, gen. sing.
   of an adj. signifying other; akin to OHG. elles otherwise,
   OSw. ["a]ljes, Sw. eljest, Goth. aljis, adj., other, L.
   alius, Gr. ?. Cf. {Alias}, {Alien}.]
   Other; one or something beside; as, Who else is coming? What
   else shall I give? Do you expect anything else? ``Bastards
   and else.'' --Shak.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: This word always follows its noun. It is usual to give
         the possessive form to else rather than to the
         substantive; as, somebody else's; no one else's. ``A
         boy who is fond of somebody else's pencil case.'' --G.
         Eliot. ``A suit of clothes like everybody else's.''
         --Thackeray.
