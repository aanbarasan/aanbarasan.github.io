      <WordDefinition>Egg
   (Heb. beytsah, "whiteness"). Eggs deserted (Isa. 10:14), of a
   bird (Deut. 22:6), an ostrich (Job 39:14), the cockatrice (Isa.
   59:5). In Luke 11:12, an egg is contrasted with a scorpion,
   which is said to be very like an egg in its appearance, so much
   so as to be with difficulty at times distinguished from it. In
   Job 6:6 ("the white of an egg") the word for egg (hallamuth')
   occurs nowhere else. It has been translated "purslain" (R.V.
   marg.), and the whole phrase "purslain-broth", i.e., broth made
   of that herb, proverbial for its insipidity; and hence an
   insipid discourse. Job applies this expression to the speech of
   Eliphaz as being insipid and dull. But the common rendering,
   "the white of an egg", may be satisfactorily maintained.

      <WordDefinition>Gamete \Gam"ete\ (g[a^]m"[=e]t; g[.a]*m[=e]t"; the latter
   usually in compounds), n. [Gr. gameth` wife, or game`ths
   husband, fr. gamei^n to marry.] (Biol.)
   A sexual cell or germ cell having a single set of unpaired
   chromosomes; a conjugating cell which unites with another of
   like or unlike character to form a new individual. In Bot.,
   gamete designates esp. the similar sex cells of the lower
   thallophytes which unite by conjugation, forming a zygospore.
   The gametes of higher plants are of two sorts, {sperm} (male)
   and {egg} (female); their union is called fertilization, and
   the resulting zygote an o["o]spore. In Zo["o]l., gamete is
   most commonly used of the sexual cells of certain Protozoa,
   though also extended to the germ cells of higher forms.
