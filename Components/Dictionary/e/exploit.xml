      <WordDefinition>exploit
     
        &lt;security&gt; A security hole or an instance of taking advantage
        of a security hole.
     
        "[...] {hackers} say exploit. {sysadmins} say hole"
        -- {Mike Emke (http://emke.com/)}.
     
        Emke reports that the stress is on the second syllable.  If
        this is true, this may be a case of hackerly zero-deriving
        verbs (especially instantials) from nouns, akin to "write" as
        a noun to describe an instance of a disk drive writing to a
        disk.
