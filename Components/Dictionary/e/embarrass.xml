   Syn: To hinder; perplex; entangle; confuse; puzzle;

        {Puzzle}, {Perplex}. We are puzzled when our faculties
        are confused by something we do not understand. We are
        perplexed when our feelings, as well as judgment, are so
        affected that we know not how to decide or act. We are
        embarrassed when there is some bar or hindrance upon us
        which impedes our powers of thought, speech, or motion.
        A schoolboy is puzzled by a difficult sum; a reasoner is
        perplexed by the subtleties of his opponent; a youth is
        sometimes so embarrassed before strangers as to lose his
        presence of mind.
        [1913 Webster]
