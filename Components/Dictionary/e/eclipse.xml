      <WordDefinition>Eclipse
   of the sun alluded to in Amos 8:9; Micah 3:6; Zech. 14:6; Joel
   2:10. Eclipses were regarded as tokens of God's anger (Joel
   3:15; Job 9:7). The darkness at the crucifixion has been
   ascribed to an eclipse (Matt. 27:45); but on the other hand it
   is argued that the great intensity of darkness caused by an
   eclipse never lasts for more than six minutes, and this darkness
   lasted for three hours. Moreover, at the time of the Passover
   the moon was full, and therefore there could not be an eclipse
   of the sun, which is caused by an interposition of the moon
   between the sun and the earth.

      <WordDefinition>Eclipse \E*clipse"\ ([-e]*kl[i^]ps"), n. [F. ['e]clipse, L.
   eclipsis, fr. Gr. 'e`kleipsis, prop., a forsaking, failing,
   fr. 'eklei`pein to leave out, forsake; 'ek out + lei`pein to
   leave. See {Ex-}, and {Loan}.]
   1. (Astron.) An interception or obscuration of the light of
      the sun, moon, or other luminous body, by the intervention
      of some other body, either between it and the eye, or
      between the luminous body and that illuminated by it. A
      lunar eclipse is caused by the moon passing through the
      earth's shadow; a solar eclipse, by the moon coming
      between the sun and the observer. A satellite is eclipsed
      by entering the shadow of its primary. The obscuration of
      a planet or star by the moon or a planet, though of the
      nature of an eclipse, is called an {occultation}. The
      eclipse of a small portion of the sun by Mercury or Venus
      is called a {transit} of the planet.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In ancient times, eclipses were, and among
         unenlightened people they still are, superstitiously
         regarded as forerunners of evil fortune, a sentiment of
         which occasional use is made in literature.
         [1913 Webster]

               That fatal and perfidious bark,
               Built in the eclipse, and rigged with curses
               dark.                              --Milton.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. The loss, usually temporary or partial, of light,
      brilliancy, luster, honor, consciousness, etc.;
      obscuration; gloom; darkness.
      [1913 Webster]

            All the posterity of our fist parents suffered a
            perpetual eclipse of spiritual life.  --Sir W.
                                                  Raleigh.
      [1913 Webster]

            As in the soft and sweet eclipse,
