   Syn: Earnest; ardent; vehement; hot; impetuous; fervent;
        intense; impassioned; zealous; forward.

   Usage: See {Earnest}. -- {Eager}, {Earnest}. Eager marks an
          excited state of desire or passion; thus, a child is
          eager for a plaything, a hungry man is eager for food,
          a covetous man is eager for gain. Eagerness is liable
          to frequent abuses, and is good or bad, as the case
          may be. It relates to what is praiseworthy or the
          contrary. Earnest denotes a permanent state of mind,
          feeling, or sentiment. It is always taken in a good
          sense; as, a preacher is earnest in his appeals to the
          conscience; an agent is earnest in his solicitations.
          [1913 Webster]
