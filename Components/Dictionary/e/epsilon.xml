      <WordDefinition>epsilon
     
        1. &lt;character&gt; The fifth letter of the Greek alphabet.
     
        2. &lt;mathematics&gt; (From the Hungarian mathematician {Paul
        Erdos}) A very small, insignificant, or negligible quantity of
        something.
     
        The use of epsilon is from the {epsilon-delta method} of
        {proof} in {differential calculus}.

        including strings and lists, developed by A.P. Ershov at

      <WordDefinition>epsilon [see {delta}] 1. n. A small quantity of anything. "The cost is
   epsilon." 2. adj. Very small, negligible; less than {marginal}. "We can
   get this feature for epsilon cost." 3. `within epsilon of': close enough
   to be indistinguishable for all practical purposes, even closer than
   being `within delta of'. "That's not what I asked for, but it's within
   epsilon of what I wanted." Alternatively, it may mean not close enough,
   but very little is required to get it there: "My program is within
   epsilon of working."
