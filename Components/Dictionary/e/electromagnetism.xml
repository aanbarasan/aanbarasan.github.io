      <WordDefinition>Electro-magnetism \E*lec`tro-mag"net*ism\ n.
   1. magnetism produced by an electric current.
      [WordNet 1.5]

   2. one of the fundamental forces of nature, responsible for
      both electrical and magnetic phenomena. Called also the
      {electromagnetic force}. Formerly believed to be separate
      phenomena, electricity and magnetism were shown by
      experiment and theory to be different aspects of the
      {electromagnetic force}. It is responsible for the forces
      generated between magnetically or electrically charged
      objects, and is the fundamental force responsible for the
      characteristics of electromagnetic radiation, including
      light.
      [PJC]

   3. the branch of physics concerned with electromagnetic
      phenomena.

     n 1: magnetism produced by an electric current; "electromagnetism
          was discovered when it was observed that a copper wire
          carrying an electric current can magnetize pieces of
          iron or steel near it"
     2: the branch of physics concerned with electromagnetic
        phenomena [syn: {electromagnetics}]
