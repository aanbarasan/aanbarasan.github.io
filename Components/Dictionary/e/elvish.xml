        &lt;character&gt; 1. The Tengwar of Feanor, a table of letterforms
        resembling the beautiful Celtic half-uncial hand of the "Book
        of Kells".  Invented and described by J.R.R. Tolkien in "The
        Lord of The Rings" as an orthography for his fictional
        "elvish" languages, this system (which is both visually and
        phonetically {elegant}) has long fascinated hackers (who tend
        to be intrigued by artificial languages in general).  It is
        traditional for graphics printers, plotters, window systems,
        and the like to support a Feanorian typeface as one of their
        demo items.  By extension, the term might be used for any odd
        or unreadable typeface produced by a graphics device.
     
        2. The typeface mundanely called "B"ocklin", an art-decoish
        {display font}.  [Why?]
