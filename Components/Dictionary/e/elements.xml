      <WordDefinition>Elements
   In its primary sense, as denoting the first principles or
   constituents of things, it is used in 2 Pet. 3:10: "The elements
   shall be dissolved." In a secondary sense it denotes the first
   principles of any art or science. In this sense it is used in
   Gal. 4:3, 9; Col. 2:8, 20, where the expressions, "elements of
   the world," "week and beggarly elements," denote that state of
   religious knowledge existing among the Jews before the coming of
   Christ, the rudiments of religious teaching. They are "of the
   world," because they are made up of types which appeal to the
   senses. They are "weak," because insufficient; and "beggarly,"
   or "poor," because they are dry and barren, not being
   accompanied by an outpouring of spiritual gifts and graces, as
   the gospel is.
