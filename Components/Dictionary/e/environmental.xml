            THOUSANDS of dead fish and other marine species,
            suffocated by a rotting, glutinous morass which
            spreads over kilometres of coral reefs.
            This scenario has all the hallmarks of a unnatural
            environmental disaster resulting from environmental
            negligence. However this isn't the case, instead the
            cause -- coral spawn slick deoxygenation -- is a
            natural event which has the potential to occur
            periodically on the reefs of the West Pilbara.
