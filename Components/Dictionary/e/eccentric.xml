      combinations of eccentric circles.

   {Eccentric gear}. (Mach.)
      (a) The whole apparatus, strap, and other parts, by which
          the motion of an eccentric is transmitted, as in the
          steam engine.
      (b) A cogwheel set to turn about an eccentric axis used to
          give variable rotation.

   {Eccentric hook} or {Eccentric gab}, a hook-shaped journal
