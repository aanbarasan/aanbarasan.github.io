      <WordDefinition>Eye
   (Heb. 'ain, meaning "flowing"), applied (1) to a fountain,
   frequently; (2) to colour (Num. 11:7; R.V., "appearance," marg.
   "eye"); (3) the face (Ex. 10:5, 15; Num. 22:5, 11), in Num.
   14:14, "face to face" (R.V. marg., "eye to eye"). "Between the
   eyes", i.e., the forehead (Ex. 13:9, 16).
   
     The expression (Prov. 23:31), "when it giveth his colour in
   the cup," is literally, "when it giveth out [or showeth] its
   eye." The beads or bubbles of wine are thus spoken of. "To set
   the eyes" on any one is to view him with favour (Gen. 44:21; Job
   24:23; Jer. 39:12). This word is used figuratively in the
   expressions an "evil eye" (Matt. 20:15), a "bountiful eye"
   (Prov. 22:9), "haughty eyes" (6:17 marg.), "wanton eyes" (Isa.
   3:16), "eyes full of adultery" (2 Pet. 2:14), "the lust of the
   eyes" (1 John 2:16). Christians are warned against "eye-service"
   (Eph. 6:6; Col. 3:22). Men were sometimes punished by having
   their eyes put out (1 Sam. 11:2; Samson, Judg. 16:21; Zedekiah,
   2 Kings 25:7).
   
     The custom of painting the eyes is alluded to in 2 Kings 9:30,
   R.V.; Jer. 4:30; Ezek. 23:40, a custom which still prevails
   extensively among Eastern women.

      <WordDefinition>Eye \Eye\ ([imac]), n. [OE. eghe, eighe, eie, eye, AS. e['a]ge;

   auge, Icel. auga, Sw. ["o]ga, Dan. ["o]ie, Goth. aug[=o]; cf.
   OSlav. oko, Lith. akis, L. okulus, Gr. 'o`kkos, eye, 'o`sse,
   the two eyes, Skr. akshi. [root]10, 212. Cf. {Diasy},
   {Ocular}, {Optic}, {Eyelet}, {Ogle}.]
   1. The organ of sight or vision. In man, and the vertebrates
      generally, it is properly the movable ball or globe in the
      orbit, but the term often includes the adjacent parts. In
      most invertebrates the eyes are immovable ocelli, or
      compound eyes made up of numerous ocelli. See {Ocellus}.
      Description of illustration: a b Conjunctiva; c Cornea; d
      Sclerotic; e Choroid; f Cillary Muscle; g Cillary Process;
      h Iris; i Suspensory Ligament; k Prosterior Aqueous
      Chamber between h and i; l Anterior Aqueous Chamber; m
      Crystalline Lens; n Vitreous Humor; o Retina; p Yellow
      spot; q Center of blind spot; r Artery of Retina in center
      of the Optic Nerve.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The essential parts of the eye are inclosed in a tough
         outer coat, the sclerotic, to which the muscles moving
         it are attached, and which in front changes into the
         transparent cornea. A little way back of cornea, the
         crystalline lens is suspended, dividing the eye into
         two unequal cavities, a smaller one in front filled
         with a watery fluid, the aqueous humor, and larger one
         behind filled with a clear jelly, the vitreous humor.
         The sclerotic is lined with a highly pigmented
         membrane, the choroid, and this is turn is lined in the
         back half of the eyeball with the nearly transparent
         retina, in which the fibers of the optic nerve ramify.
         The choroid in front is continuous with the iris, which
         has a contractile opening in the center, the pupil,
         admitting light to the lens which brings the rays to a
         focus and forms an image upon the retina, where the
         light, falling upon delicate structures called rods and
         cones, causes them to stimulate the fibres of the optic
         nerve to transmit visual impressions to the brain.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. The faculty of seeing; power or range of vision; hence,
      judgment or taste in the use of the eye, and in judging of

      beautiful or picturesque.

      [1913 Webster]

   4. The space commanded by the organ of sight; scope of
