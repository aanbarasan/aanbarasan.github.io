      <WordDefinition>Expect \Ex*pect"\, v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Expected}; p. pr. &amp; vb.
   n. {Expecting}.] [L. expectatum, to look out for, await,
   expect; ex + out spectare to look at. See {Spectacle}.]
   1. To wait for; to await. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

            Let's in, and there expect their coming. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. To look for (mentally); to look forward to, as to
      something that is believed to be about to happen or come;
      to have a previous apprehension of, whether of good or
      evil; to look for with some confidence; to anticipate; --
      often followed by an infinitive, sometimes by a clause
      (with, or without, that); as, I expect to receive wages; I
      expect that the troops will be defeated. ``Good: I will
      expect you.'' --Shak. ``Expecting thy reply.'' --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            The Somersetshire or yellow regiment . . . was
            expected to arrive on the following day. --Macaulay.

   Syn: To anticipate; look for; await; hope.

   Usage: To {Expect}, {Think}, {Believe}, {Await}. Expect is a
          mental act and has aways a reference to the future, to
          some coming event; as a person expects to die, or he
          expects to survive. Think and believe have reference
          to the past and present, as well as to the future; as
          I think the mail has arrived; I believe he came home
          yesterday, that he is he is at home now. There is a
          not uncommon use of expect, which is a confusion of
          the two; as, I expect the mail has arrived; I expect
          he is at home. This misuse should be avoided. Await is
          a physical or moral act. We await that which, when it
          comes, will affect us personally. We expect what may,
          or may not, interest us personally. See {Anticipate}.
          [1913 Webster]
