      <WordDefinition>Eulogy \Eu"lo*gy\, n.; pl. {Eulogies}. [Gr. ?, from ? well
   speaking; e'y^ well + ? to speak. Cf. {Eulogium}, and see
   {Legend}.]
   A speech or writing in commendation of the character or
   services of a person; as, a fitting eulogy to worth.
   [1913 Webster]

         Eulogies turn into elegies.              --Spenser.

   Syn: Encomium; praise; panegyric; applause.

   Usage: {Eulogy}, {Eulogium}, {Encomium}, {Panegyric}. The
          idea of praise is common to all these words. The word
          encomium is used of both persons and things which are
          the result of human action, and denotes warm praise.
          Eulogium and eulogy apply only to persons and are more
          studied and of greater length. A panegyric was
          originally a set speech in a full assembly of the
          people, and hence denotes a more formal eulogy,
          couched in terms of warm and continuous praise,
          especially as to personal character. We may bestow
          encomiums on any work of art, on production of genius,
          without reference to the performer; we bestow
          eulogies, or pronounce a eulogium, upon some
          individual distinguished for his merit public
          services; we pronounce a panegyric before an assembly
          gathered for the occasion.
          [1913 Webster]
