      <WordDefinition>Ear
   used frequently in a figurative sense (Ps. 34:15). To "uncover
   the ear" is to show respect to a person (1 Sam. 20:2 marg.). To
   have the "ear heavy", or to have "uncircumcised ears" (Isa.
   6:10), is to be inattentive and disobedient. To have the ear
   "bored" through with an awl was a sign of perpetual servitude
   (Ex. 21:6).

   1. The organ of hearing; the external ear.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In man and the higher vertebrates, the organ of hearing
         is very complicated, and is divisible into three parts:
         the external ear, which includes the pinna or auricle
         and meatus or external opening; the middle ear, drum,
         or tympanum; and the internal ear, or labyrinth. The
         middle ear is a cavity connected by the Eustachian tube
         with the pharynx, separated from the opening of the
         external ear by the tympanic membrane, and containing a
         chain of three small bones, or ossicles, named malleus,
         incus, and stapes, which connect this membrane with the
         internal ear. The essential part of the internal ear
         where the fibers of the auditory nerve terminate, is
         the membranous labyrinth, a complicated system of sacs
         and tubes filled with a fluid (the endolymph), and
         lodged in a cavity, called the bony labyrinth, in the
         periotic bone. The membranous labyrinth does not
         completely fill the bony labyrinth, but is partially
         suspended in it in a fluid (the perilymph). The bony
         labyrinth consists of a central cavity, the vestibule,
         into which three semicircular canals and the canal of
         the cochlea (spirally coiled in mammals) open. The
         vestibular portion of the membranous labyrinth consists
         of two sacs, the utriculus and sacculus, connected by a
         narrow tube, into the former of which three membranous
         semicircular canals open, while the latter is connected
         with a membranous tube in the cochlea containing the
         organ of Corti. By the help of the external ear the
         sonorous vibrations of the air are concentrated upon
         the tympanic membrane and set it vibrating, the chain
         of bones in the middle ear transmits these vibrations
         to the internal ear, where they cause certain delicate
         structures in the organ of Corti, and other parts of
         the membranous labyrinth, to stimulate the fibers of
         the auditory nerve to transmit sonorous impulses to the
         brain.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. The sense of hearing; the perception of sounds; the power
      of discriminating between different tones; as, a nice ear
      for music; -- in the singular only.
      [1913 Webster]

            Songs . . . not all ungrateful to thine ear.
                                                  --Tennyson.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. That which resembles in shape or position the ear of an
      animal; any prominence or projection on an object, --
      usually one for support or attachment; a lug; a handle;
      as, the ears of a tub, a skillet, or dish. The ears of a
      boat are outside kneepieces near the bow. See Illust. of
      {Bell}.

            Dionysius . . . would give no ear to his suit.
                                                  --Bacon.
      [1913 Webster]

            Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.
                                                  --Shak.
