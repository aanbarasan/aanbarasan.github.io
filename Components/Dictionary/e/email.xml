      <WordDefinition>email /ee'mayl/ (also written `e-mail' and `E-mail') 1. n. Electronic
   mail automatically passed through computer networks and/or via modems
   over common-carrier lines. Contrast {snail-mail}, {paper-net},
   {voice-net}. See {network address}. 2. vt. To send electronic mail.

   Oddly enough, the word `emailed' is actually listed in the OED; it
   means "embossed (with a raised pattern) or perh. arranged in a net or
   open work". A use from 1480 is given. The word is probably derived from
   French `e'maille'' (enameled) and related to Old French `emmailleu"re'
   (network). A French correspondent tells us that in modern French,
   `email' is a hard enamel obtained by heating special paints in a
   furnace; an `emailleur' (no final e) is a craftsman who makes email (he
   generally paints some objects (like, say, jewelry) and cooks them in a
   furnace).

   There are numerous spelling variants of this word. In Internet traffic
   up to 1995, `email' predominates, `e-mail' runs a not-too-distant
   second, and `E-mail' and `Email' are a distant third and fourth.
