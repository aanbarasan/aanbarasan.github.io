      <WordDefinition>Except \Ex*cept"\, prep. [Originally past participle, or verb in
   the imperative mode.]
   With exclusion of; leaving or left out; excepting.
   [1913 Webster]

         God and his Son except,
         Created thing naught valued he nor . . . shunned.
                                                  --Milton.

   Syn: {Except}, {Excepting}, {But}, {Save}, {Besides}.

   Usage: Excepting, except, but, and save are exclusive. Except
          marks exclusion more pointedly. ``I have finished all
          the letters except one,'' is more marked than ``I have
          finished all the letters but one.'' Excepting is the
          same as except, but less used. Save is chiefly found
          in poetry. Besides (lit., by the side of) is in the
          nature of addition. ``There is no one here except or
          but him,'' means, take him away and there is nobody
          present. ``There is nobody here besides him,'' means,
          he is present and by the side of, or in addition to,
          him is nobody. ``Few ladies, except her Majesty, could
          have made themselves heard.'' In this example, besides
          should be used, not except.

      <WordDefinition>Except \Ex*cept"\ ([e^]k*s[e^]pt"), conj.
   Unless; if it be not so that.
   [1913 Webster]

         And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless
         me.                                      --Gen. xxxii.
                                                  26.
   [1913 Webster]

         But yesterday you never opened lip,
         Except, indeed, to drink.                --Tennyson.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: As a conjunction unless has mostly taken the place of
         except.
