      <WordDefinition>Easter
   originally a Saxon word (Eostre), denoting a goddess of the
   Saxons, in honour of whom sacrifices were offered about the time
   of the Passover. Hence the name came to be given to the festival
   of the Resurrection of Christ, which occured at the time of the
   Passover. In the early English versions this word was frequently
   used as the translation of the Greek pascha (the Passover). When
   the Authorized Version (1611) was formed, the word "passover"
   was used in all passages in which this word pascha occurred,
   except in Act 12:4. In the Revised Version the proper word,
   "passover," is always used.

      <WordDefinition>Easter \Eas"ter\ ([=e]s"t[~e]r), n. [AS. e['a]ster, e['a]stran,
   paschal feast, Easter; akin to G. ostern; fr. AS. E['a]stre,
   a goddess of light or spring, in honor of whom a festival was

   1. An annual church festival commemorating Christ's
      resurrection, and occurring on Sunday, the second day
      after Good Friday. It corresponds to the pascha or
      passover of the Jews, and most nations still give it this
      name under the various forms of {pascha}, {pasque},
      {p[^a]que}, or {pask}.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. The day on which the festival is observed; Easter day.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Easter day, on which the rest of the movable feasts
         depend, is always the first Sunday after the fourteenth
         day of the calendar moon which (fourteenth day) falls
         on, or next after, the 21st of March, according to the
         rules laid down for the construction of the calendar;
         so that if the fourteenth day happen on a Sunday,
         Easter day is the Sunday after. --Eng. Cyc.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Easter dues} (Ch. of Eng.), money due to the clergy at
