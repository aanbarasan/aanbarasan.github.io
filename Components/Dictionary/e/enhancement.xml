      <WordDefinition>enhancement
     
        1. A change to a product which is intended to make it better
        in some way, e.g. new functions, faster, or occasionally more
        compatible with other systems.  Enhancements to {hardware}
        components, especially {integrated circuits} often mean they
        are smaller and less demanding of resources.  Sadly, this is
        almost never true of {software} enhancements.
     
        2. {Marketroid}-speak for a {bug fix}.  This abuse of language
        is a popular and time-tested way to turn incompetence into
        increased revenue.  A hacker being ironic would instead call
        the fix a {feature}, or perhaps save some effort by declaring
        "{That's not a bug, that's a feature!}".

      <WordDefinition>enhancement n. Common {marketroid}-speak for a bug {fix}. This abuse of
   language is a popular and time-tested way to turn incompetence into
   increased revenue. A hacker being ironic would instead call the fix a
   {feature} -- or perhaps save some effort by declaring the bug itself to
   be a feature.
