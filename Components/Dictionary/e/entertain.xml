      <WordDefinition>Entertain
   Entertainments, "feasts," were sometimes connected with a public
   festival (Deut. 16:11, 14), and accompanied by offerings (1 Sam.
   9:13), in token of alliances (Gen. 26:30); sometimes in
   connection with domestic or social events, as at the weaning of
   children (Gen. 21:8), at weddings (Gen. 29:22; John 2:1), on
   birth-days (Matt. 14:6), at the time of sheep-shearing (2 Sam.
   13:23), and of vintage (Judg. 9:27), and at funerals (2 Sam.
   3:35; Jer. 16:7).
   
     The guests were invited by servants (Prov. 9:3; Matt. 22:3),
   who assigned them their respective places (1 Sam. 9:22; Luke
   14:8; Mark 12:39). Like portions were sent by the master to each
   guest (1 Sam. 1:4; 2 Sam. 6:19), except when special honour was
   intended, when the portion was increased (Gen. 43:34).
   
     The Israelites were forbidden to attend heathenish sacrificial
   entertainments (Ex. 34:15), because these were in honour of
   false gods, and because at such feast they would be liable to
   partake of unclean flesh (1 Cor. 10:28).
   
     In the entertainments common in apostolic times among the
   Gentiles were frequent "revellings," against which Christians
   were warned (Rom. 13:13; Gal. 5:21; 1 Pet. 4:3). (See {BANQUET}.)
