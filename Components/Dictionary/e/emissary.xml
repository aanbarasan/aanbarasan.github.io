      <WordDefinition>Emissary \Em"is*sa*ry\, n.; pl. {Emissaries}. [L. emissarius,
   fr. emittere, emissum, to send out: cf. F. ['e]missaire. See
   {Emit}.]
   An agent employed to advance, in a covert manner, the
   interests of his employers; one sent out by any power that is
   at war with another, to create dissatisfaction among the
   people of the latter.
   [1913 Webster]

         Buzzing emissaries fill the ears
         Of listening crowds with jealousies and fears.
                                                  --Dryden.

   Syn: {Emissary}, {Spy}.

   Usage: A spy is one who enters an enemy's camp or territories
          to learn the condition of the enemy; an emissary may
          be a secret agent appointed not only to detect the
          schemes of an opposing party, but to influence their
          councils. A spy must be concealed, or he suffers
          death; an emissary may in some cases be known as the
          agent of an adversary without incurring similar
          hazard.
          [1913 Webster]
