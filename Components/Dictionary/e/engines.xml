      <WordDefinition>Engines
   (1.) Heb. hishalon i.e., "invention" (as in Eccl. 7:29)
   contrivances indicating ingenuity. In 2 Chr. 26:15 it refers to
   inventions for the purpose of propelling missiles from the walls
   of a town, such as stones (the Roman balista) and arrows (the
   catapulta).
   
     (2.) Heb. mechi kobollo, i.e., the beating of that which is in
   front a battering-ram (Ezek. 26:9), the use of which was common
   among the Egyptians and the Assyrians. Such an engine is
   mentioned in the reign of David (2 Sam. 20:15).
