      <WordDefinition>Eating
   The ancient Hebrews would not eat with the Egyptians (Gen.
   43:32). In the time of our Lord they would not eat with
   Samaritans (John 4:9), and were astonished that he ate with
   publicans and sinners (Matt. 9:11). The Hebrews originally sat
   at table, but afterwards adopted the Persian and Chaldean
   practice of reclining (Luke 7:36-50). Their principal meal was
   at noon (Gen. 43:16; 1 Kings 20:16; Ruth 2:14; Luke 14:12). The
   word "eat" is used metaphorically in Jer. 15:16; Ezek. 3:1; Rev.
   10:9. In John 6:53-58, "eating and drinking" means believing in
   Christ. Women were never present as guests at meals (q.v.).
