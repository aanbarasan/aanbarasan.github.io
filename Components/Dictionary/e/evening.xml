      <WordDefinition>Evening
   the period following sunset with which the Jewish day began
   (Gen. 1:5; Mark 13:35). The Hebrews reckoned two evenings of
   each day, as appears from Ex. 16:12: 30:8; 12:6 (marg.); Lev.
   23:5 (marg. R.V., "between the two evenings"). The "first
   evening" was that period when the sun was verging towards
   setting, and the "second evening" the moment of actual sunset.
   The word "evenings" in Jer. 5:6 should be "deserts" (marg.
   R.V.).
