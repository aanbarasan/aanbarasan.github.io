      <WordDefinition>evil
     
        As used by a {hacker}, implies that some system, program,
        person, or institution is sufficiently maldesigned as to be
        not worth the bother of dealing with.  Unlike the adjectives
        in the cretinous, {losing}, {brain-damaged} series, "evil"
        does not imply incompetence or bad design, but rather a set of
        goals or design criteria fatally incompatible with the
        speaker's.  This usage is more an aesthetic and engineering
        judgment than a moral one in the mainstream sense.  "We
        thought about adding a {Blue Glue} interface but decided it
        was too evil to deal with."  "{TECO} is neat, but it can be
        pretty evil if you're prone to typos."  Often pronounced with
        the first syllable lengthened, as /eeee'vil/.
     
        Compare {evil and rude}.
