      <WordDefinition>Eucalyptus \Eu`ca*lyp"tus\, n. [NL., from Gr. e'y^ well, good +
   ? covered. The buds of Eucalyptus have a hemispherical or

   Note: They have rigid, entire leaves with one edge turned
         toward the zenith. Most of them secrete resinous gums,
         whence they called {gum trees}, and their timber is of
         great value. {Eucalyptus Globulus} is the blue gum; {E.
         gigantea}, the stringy bark: {E. amygdalina}, the
         peppermint tree. {E. Gunnii}, the Tasmanian cider tree,
         yields a refreshing drink from wounds made in the bark
         in the spring. Other species yield oils, tars, acids,
         dyes and tans. It is said that miasmatic valleys in
         Algeria and Portugal, and a part of the unhealthy Roman
         Campagna, have been made more salubrious by planting
         groves of these trees.
