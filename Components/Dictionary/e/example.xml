                                                  15.

            Now these things were our examples, to the intent
            that we should not lust after evil things, as they
            also lusted.                          --1 Cor. x. 6.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. An instance serving for illustration of a rule or precept,
      especially a problem to be solved, or a case to be
      determined, as an exercise in the application of the rules
      of any study or branch of science; as, in trigonometry and
      grammar, the principles and rules are illustrated by
      examples.

   Syn: Precedent; case; instance.

   Usage: {Example}, {Instance}. The discrimination to be made
          between these two words relates to cases in which we
          give ``instances'' or ``examples'' of things done. An
          instance denotes the single case then ``standing''
          before us; if there be others like it, the word does
          not express this fact. On the contrary, an example is
          one of an entire class of like things, and should be a
          true representative or sample of that class. Hence, an
          example proves a rule or regular course of things; an
          instance simply points out what may be true only in
          the case presented. A man's life may be filled up with
          examples of the self-command and kindness which marked
          his character, and may present only a solitary
          instance of haste or severity. Hence, the word
          ``example'' should never be used to describe what
          stands singly and alone. We do, however, sometimes
          apply the word instance to what is really an example,
          because we are not thinking of the latter under this
          aspect, but solely as a case which ``stands before
          us.'' See {Precedent}.
