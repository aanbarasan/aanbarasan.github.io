      <WordDefinition>Earrings
   rings properly for the ear (Gen. 35:4; Num. 31:50; Ezek. 16:12).
   In Gen. 24:47 the word means a nose-jewel, and is so rendered in
   the Revised Version. In Isa. 3:20 the Authorized Version has
   "ear-rings," and the Revised Version "amulets," which more
   correctly represents the original word (lehashim), which means
   incantations; charms, thus remedies against enchantment, worn
   either suspended from the neck or in the ears of females.
   Ear-rings were ornaments used by both sexes (Ex. 32:2).
