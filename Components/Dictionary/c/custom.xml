      <WordDefinition>Custom
   a tax imposed by the Romans. The tax-gatherers were termed
   publicans (q.v.), who had their stations at the gates of cities,
   and in the public highways, and at the place set apart for that
   purpose, called the "receipt of custom" (Matt.9: 9; Mark 2:14),
   where they collected the money that was to be paid on certain
   goods (Matt.17:25). These publicans were tempted to exact more
   from the people than was lawful, and were, in consequence of
   their extortions, objects of great hatred. The Pharisees would
   have no intercourse with them (Matt.5:46, 47; 9:10, 11).
   
     A tax or tribute (q.v.) of half a shekel was annually paid by
   every adult Jew for the temple. It had to be paid in Jewish coin
   (Matt. 22:17-19; Mark 12:14, 15). Money-changers (q.v.) were
   necessary, to enable the Jews who came up to Jerusalem at the
   feasts to exchange their foreign coin for Jewish money; but as
   it was forbidden by the law to carry on such a traffic for
   emolument (Deut. 23:19, 20), our Lord drove them from the temple
   (Matt. 21:12: Mark 11:15).
