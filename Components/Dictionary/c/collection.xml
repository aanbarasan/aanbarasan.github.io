      <WordDefinition>Collection
   The Christians in Palestine, from various causes, suffered from
   poverty. Paul awakened an interest in them among the Gentile
   churches, and made pecuniary collections in their behalf (Acts
   24:17; Rom. 15:25, 26; 1 Cor. 16:1-3; 2 Cor. 8:9; Gal. 2:10).

      <WordDefinition>Collection \Col*lec"tion\, n. [L. collectio: cf. F. collection.]
   1. The act or process of collecting or of gathering; as, the
      collection of specimens.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. That which is collected; as:
      (a) A gathering or assemblage of objects or of persons.
          ``A collection of letters.'' --Macaulay.
      (b) A gathering of money for charitable or other purposes,
          as by passing a contribution box for freewill
          offerings. ``The collection for the saints.'' --1 Cor.

      observed facts; also, that which is inferred. [Obs.]

            We may safely say thus, that wrong collections have
            been hitherto made out of those words by modern
            divines.                              --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]
