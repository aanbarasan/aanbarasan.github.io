      <WordDefinition>Chain
   (1.) A part of the insignia of office. A chain of gold was
   placed about Joseph's neck (Gen. 41:42); and one was promised to
   Daniel (5:7). It is used as a symbol of sovereignty (Ezek.
   16:11). The breast-plate of the high-priest was fastened to the
   ephod by golden chains (Ex. 39:17, 21).
   
     (2.) It was used as an ornament (Prov. 1:9; Cant. 1:10). The
   Midianites adorned the necks of their camels with chains (Judg.
   8:21, 26).
   
     (3.) Chains were also used as fetters wherewith prisoners were
   bound (Judg. 16:21; 2 Sam. 3:34; 2 Kings 25:7; Jer. 39:7). Paul
   was in this manner bound to a Roman soldier (Acts 28:20; Eph.
   6:20; 2 Tim. 1:16). Sometimes, for the sake of greater security,
   the prisoner was attached by two chains to two soldiers, as in
   the case of Peter (Acts 12:6).

      <WordDefinition>chain
     
        1. &lt;operating system&gt; (From {BASIC}'s "CHAIN" statement) To
        pass control to a child or successor without going through the
        {operating system} {command interpreter} that invoked you.
        The state of the parent program is lost and there is no
        returning to it.  Though this facility used to be common on
        memory-limited {microcomputers} and is still widely supported
        for {backward compatibility}, the jargon usage is
        semi-obsolescent; in particular, {Unix} calls this {exec}.
     
        Compare with the more modern "{subshell}".
     
        2. &lt;programming&gt; A series of linked data areas within an
        {operating system} or {application program}.  "Chain rattling"
        is the process of repeatedly running through the linked data
        areas searching for one which is of interest.  The implication
        is that there are many links in the chain.
     
        3. &lt;theory&gt; A possibly infinite, non-decreasing sequence of
        elements of some {total ordering}, S
     
        	x0 &lt;= x1 &lt;= x2 ...
     
        A chain satisfies:
     
        	for all x,y in S, x &lt;= y \/ y &lt;= x.
     
        I.e. any two elements of a chain are related.
     
        ("&lt;=" is written in {LaTeX} as {\sqsubseteq}).

      <WordDefinition>chain 1. vi. [orig. from BASIC's `CHAIN' statement] To hand off
   execution to a child or successor without going through the {OS} command
   interpreter that invoked it. The state of the parent program is lost and
   there is no returning to it. Though this facility used to be common on
   memory-limited micros and is still widely supported for backward
   compatibility, the jargon usage is semi-obsolescent; in particular, most
   Unix programmers will think of this as an {exec}. Oppose the more modern
   `subshell'. 2. n. A series of linked data areas within an operating
   system or application. `Chain rattling' is the process of repeatedly
   running through the linked data areas searching for one which is of
   interest to the executing program. The implication is that there is a
   very large number of links on the chain.
