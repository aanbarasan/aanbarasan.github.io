      <WordDefinition>Condor \Con"dor\ (k[o^]n"d[o^]r; in defs. 2 &amp; 3, k[-o]n"d[-o]r),
   n. [Sp. condor, fr. Peruvian cuntur.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) A very large bird of the Vulture family
      ({Sarcorhamphus gryphus}), found in the most elevated

   2. (Zo["o]l.) The California vulture ({Gymnogyps
      californianus}), also called {California condor}. [Local,
      U. S.]

   Note: In the late 20th century it is classed as an endangered
         species. The California condor used to number in the
         thousands and ranged along the entire west coast of the
         United States. By 1982 only 21 to 24 individuals could
         be identified in the wild. A breeding program was
         instituted, and by 1996 over 50 birds were alive in
         captivity. As of 1997, fewer than ten of the bred birds
         had been reintroduced into the wild.
         [Webster 1913 Suppl. +PJC]

   3. A gold coin of Chile, bearing the figure of a condor, and
      equal to twenty pesos. It contains 10.98356 grams of gold,

      [Webster 1913 Suppl.]

   4. A gold coin of Colombia equivalent to about $9.65. It is
      no longer coined.
