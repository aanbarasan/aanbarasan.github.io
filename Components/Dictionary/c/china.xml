   Introduction China
   ------------------
                            Background: For centuries China stood as a
                                        leading civilization, outpacing the
                                        rest of the world in the arts and
                                        sciences. But in the 19th and early
                                        20th centuries, China was beset by
                                        civil unrest, major famines,
                                        military defeats, and foreign
                                        occupation. After World War II, the
                                        Communists under MAO Zedong
                                        established a dictatorship that,
                                        while ensuring China's sovereignty,
                                        imposed strict controls over
                                        everyday life and cost the lives of
                                        tens of millions of people. After
                                        1978, his successor DENG Xiaoping
                                        gradually introduced market-oriented
                                        reforms and decentralized economic
                                        decision making, and output
                                        quadrupled by 2000. Political
                                        controls remain tight even while
                                        economic controls continue to be
                                        relaxed.

                                        operates within a political
                                        framework of strict Communist
                                        control, the economic influence of
                                        non-state organizations and
                                        individual citizens has been
                                        steadily increasing. The authorities
                                        have switched to a system of
                                        household and village responsibility
                                        in agriculture in place of the old
                                        collectivization, increased the
                                        authority of local officials and
                                        plant managers in industry,
                                        permitted a wide variety of small-
                                        scale enterprise in services and
                                        light manufacturing, and opened the
                                        economy to increased foreign trade
                                        and investment. The result has been
                                        a quadrupling of GDP since 1978. In
                                        2001, with its 1.27 billion people
                                        but a GDP of just $4,300 per capita,
                                        China stood as the second largest
                                        economy in the world after the US
                                        (measured on a purchasing power
                                        parity basis). Agriculture and
                                        industry have posted major gains,
                                        especially in coastal areas near
                                        Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where
                                        foreign investment has helped spur
                                        output of both domestic and export
                                        goods. On the darker side, the
                                        leadership has often experienced in
                                        its hybrid system the worst results
                                        of socialism (bureaucracy and
                                        lassitude) and of capitalism
                                        (windfall gains and growing income
                                        disparities). Beijing thus has
                                        periodically backtracked,
                                        retightening central controls at
                                        intervals. The government has
                                        struggled to (a) collect revenues
                                        due from provinces, businesses, and
                                        individuals; (b) reduce corruption
                                        and other economic crimes; and (c)
                                        keep afloat the large state-owned
                                        enterprises many of which had been
                                        shielded from competition by
                                        subsidies and had been losing the
                                        ability to pay full wages and
                                        pensions. From 80 to 120 million
                                        surplus rural workers are adrift
                                        between the villages and the cities,
                                        many subsisting through part-time
                                        low-paying jobs. Popular resistance,
                                        changes in central policy, and loss
                                        of authority by rural cadres have
                                        weakened China's population control
                                        program, which is essential to
                                        maintaining long-term growth in
                                        living standards. Another long-term
                                        threat to continued rapid economic
                                        growth is the deterioration in the
                                        environment, notably air pollution,
                                        soil erosion, and the steady fall of
                                        the water table especially in the
                                        north. China continues to lose
                                        arable land because of erosion and
                                        economic development. Beijing will
                                        intensify efforts to stimulate
                                        growth through spending on
                                        infrastructure - such as water
                                        control and power grids - and
                                        poverty relief and through rural tax
                                        reform aimed at eliminating
                                        arbitrary local levies on farmers.
                                        Access to the World Trade
                                        Organization strengthens China's
                                        ability to maintain sturdy growth
                                        rates, and at the same time puts
                                        additional pressure on the hybrid
                                        system of strong political controls
                                        and growing market influences.
                                        Although Beijing has claimed 7%-8%
                                        annual growth in recent years, many
                                        observers believe the rate, while
                                        strong, is more like 5%.
