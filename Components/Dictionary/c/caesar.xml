      <WordDefinition>Caesar
   the title assumed by the Roman emperors after Julius Caesar. In
   the New Testament this title is given to various emperors as
   sovereigns of Judaea without their accompanying distinctive
   proper names (John 19:15; Acts 17:7). The Jews paid tribute to
   Caesar (Matt. 22:17), and all Roman citizens had the right of
   appeal to him (Acts 25:11). The Caesars referred to in the New
   Testament are Augustus (Luke 2:1), Tiberius (3:1; 20:22),
   Claudius (Acts 11:28), and Nero (Acts 25:8; Phil. 4:22).

   A Roman emperor, as being the successor of Augustus C[ae]sar.

   [1913 Webster]

         Malborough anticipated the day when he would be
         servilely flattered and courted by C[ae]sar on one side
         and by Louis the Great on the other.     --Macaulay.
