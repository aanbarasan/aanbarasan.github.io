   Syn: Proselyte; neophyte.

   Usage: {Convert}, {Proselyte}, {Pervert}. A convert is one
          who turns from what he believes to have been a decided
          error of faith or practice. Such a change may relate
          to religion, politics, or other subjects. properly
          considered, it is not confined to speculation alone,
          but affects the whole current of one's feelings and
          the tenor of his actions. As such a change carries
          with it the appearance of sincerity, the term convert
          is usually taken in a good sense. Proselyte is a term
          of more ambiguous use and application. It was first
          applied to an adherent of one religious system who had
          transferred himself externally to some other religious
          system; and is also applied to one who makes a similar
          transfer in respect to systems of philosophy or
          speculation. The term has little or no reference to
          the state of the heart. Pervert is a term of recent
          origin, designed to express the contrary of convert,
          and to stigmatize a person as drawn off perverted from
          the true faith. It has been more particulary applied
          by members of the Church of England to those who have
          joined the Roman Catholic Church.
