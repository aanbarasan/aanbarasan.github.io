   F. concession. See {Concede}.]

      [1913 Webster]

   2. A thing yielded; an acknowledgment or admission; a boon; a
      grant; esp. a grant by government of a privilege or right
      to do something; as, a concession to build a canal.
      [1913 Webster]

      [1913 Webster]

            without further pursuits, then expect to find
            popular assemblies content with small concessions.
                                                  --Swift.
