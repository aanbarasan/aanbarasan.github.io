      <WordDefinition>crash
     
        1. A sudden, usually drastic failure.  Most often said of the
        {system}, especially of magnetic disk drives (the term
        originally described what happened when the air gap of a hard
        disk collapses).  "Three {lusers} lost their files in last
        night's disk crash."  A disk crash that involves the
        read/write heads dropping onto the surface of the disks and
        scraping off the oxide may also be referred to as a "head
        crash", whereas the term "system crash" usually, though not
        always, implies that the operating system or other software
        was at fault.
     
        2. To fail suddenly.  "Has the system just crashed?"
        "Something crashed the OS!" See {down}.  Also used
        transitively to indicate the cause of the crash (usually a
        person or a program, or both).  "Those idiots playing
        {SPACEWAR} crashed the system."
