      <WordDefinition>cookie
     
        1. &lt;protocol&gt; A handle, transaction ID, or other token of
        agreement between cooperating programs.  "I give him a packet,
        he gives me back a cookie".
     
        The claim check you get from a dry-cleaning shop is a perfect
        mundane example of a cookie; the only thing it's useful for is
        to relate a later transaction to this one (so you get the same
        clothes back).
     
        Another example is an {HTTP cookie}.
     
        Compare {magic cookie}; see also {fortune cookie}.
     
        2. &lt;security, jargon&gt; A {cracker} term for the {password} list
        on a {multi-user} computer.
     
        3. &lt;jargon&gt; An adjective describing a computer that just
        became {toast}.
