      <WordDefinition>Comforter
   the designation of the Holy Ghost (John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7;
   R.V. marg., "or Advocate, or Helper; Gr. paracletos"). The same
   Greek word thus rendered is translated "Advocate" in 1 John 2:1
   as applicable to Christ. It means properly "one who is summoned
   to the side of another" to help him in a court of justice by
   defending him, "one who is summoned to plead a cause."
   "Advocate" is the proper rendering of the word in every case
   where it occurs.
   
     It is worthy of notice that although Paul nowhere uses the
   word paracletos, he yet presents the idea it embodies when he
   speaks of the "intercession" both of Christ and the Spirit (Rom.
   8:27, 34).
