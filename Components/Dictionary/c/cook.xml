      <WordDefinition>Cook
   a person employed to perform culinary service. In early times
   among the Hebrews cooking was performed by the mistress of the
   household (Gen. 18:2-6; Judg. 6:19), and the process was very
   expeditiously performed (Gen. 27:3, 4, 9, 10). Professional
   cooks were afterwards employed (1 Sam. 8:13; 9:23). Few animals,
   as a rule, were slaughtered (other than sacrifices), except for
   purposes of hospitality (Gen. 18:7; Luke 15:23). The paschal
   lamb was roasted over a fire (Ex. 12:8, 9; 2Chr. 35:13). Cooking
   by boiling was the usual method adopted (Lev. 8:31; Ex. 16:23).
   No cooking took place on the Sabbath day (Ex. 35:3).
