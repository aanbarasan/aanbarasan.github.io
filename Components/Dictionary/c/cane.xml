      <WordDefinition>Cane
   a tall sedgy plant with a hollow stem, growing in moist places.
   In Isa. 43:24; Jer. 6:20, the Hebrew word _kaneh_ is thus
   rendered, giving its name to the plant. It is rendered "reed" in
   1 Kings 14:15; Job 40:21; Isa. 19:6; 35:7. In Ps. 68:30 the
   expression "company of spearmen" is in the margin and the
   Revised Version "beasts of the reeds," referring probably to the
   crocodile or the hippopotamus as a symbol of Egypt. In 2 Kings
   18:21; Isa. 36:6; Ezek. 29:6, 7, the reference is to the weak,
   fragile nature of the reed. (See {CALAMUS}.)
