        1. &lt;programming&gt; The prototype for an {object} in an
        {object-oriented language}; analogous to a {derived type} in a
        {procedural language}.  A class may also be considered to be a
        set of objects which share a common structure and behaviour.
        The structure of a class is determined by the {class
        variables} which represent the {state} of an object of that
        class and the behaviour is given by a set of {methods}
        associated with the class.
     
        Classes are related in a {class hierarchy}.  One class may be
        a specialisation (a "{subclass}") of another (one of its
        "{superclasses}") or it may be composed of other classes or it
        may use other classes in a {client-server} relationship.  A
        class may be an {abstract class} or a {concrete class}.
     
        See also {signature}.
     
        2. &lt;programming&gt; See {type class}.
     
        3. &lt;networking&gt; One of three types of {Internet addresses}
        distinguished by their most significant bits.
     
        3. &lt;language&gt; A language developed by the {Andrew Project}.
        It was one of the first attempts to add {object-oriented}
        features to {C}.
