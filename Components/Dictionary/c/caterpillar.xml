      <WordDefinition>Caterpillar
   the consumer. Used in the Old Testament (1 Kings 8:37; 2 Chr.
   6:28; Ps. 78:46; Isa. 33:4) as the translation of a word (hasil)
   the root of which means "to devour" or "consume," and which is
   used also with reference to the locust in Deut. 28:38. It may
   have been a species of locust, or the name of one of the
   transformations through which the locust passes, locust-grub. It
   is also found (Ps. 105:34; Jer. 51:14, 27; R.V., "cankerworm")
   as the rendering of a different Hebrew word, _yelek_, a word
   elsewhere rendered "cankerworm" (q.v.), Joel 1:4; 2:25. (See {LOCUST}.)

      <WordDefinition>Scorpion \Scor"pi*on\, n. [F., fr. L. scorpio, scorpius, Gr. ?,
   perhaps akin to E. sharp.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) Any one of numerous species of pulmonate

   Note: Scorpions have a flattened body, and a long, slender
         post-abdomen formed of six movable segments, the last
         of which terminates in a curved venomous sting. The
         venom causes great pain, but is unattended either with
         redness or swelling, except in the axillary or inguinal
         glands, when an extremity is affected. It is seldom if
         ever destructive of life. Scorpions are found widely
         dispersed in the warm climates of both the Old and New
         Worlds.
