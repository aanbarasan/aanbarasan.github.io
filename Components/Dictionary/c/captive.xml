      <WordDefinition>Captive
   one taken in war. Captives were often treated with great cruelty
   and indignity (1 Kings 20:32; Josh. 10:24; Judg. 1:7; 2 Sam.
   4:12; Judg. 8:7; 2 Sam. 12:31; 1 Chr. 20:3). When a city was
   taken by assault, all the men were slain, and the women and
   children carried away captive and sold as slaves (Isa. 20; 47:3;
   2 Chr. 28:9-15; Ps. 44:12; Joel 3:3), and exposed to the most
   cruel treatment (Nah. 3:10; Zech. 14:2; Esther 3:13; 2 Kings
   8:12; Isa. 13:16, 18). Captives were sometimes carried away into
   foreign countries, as was the case with the Jews (Jer. 20:5;
   39:9, 10; 40:7).
