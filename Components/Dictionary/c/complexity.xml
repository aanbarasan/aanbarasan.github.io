      <WordDefinition>complexity
     
        &lt;algorithm&gt; The level in difficulty in solving mathematically
        posed problems as measured by the time, number of steps or
        arithmetic operations, or memory space required (called time
        complexity, computational complexity, and space complexity,
        respectively).
     
        The interesting aspect is usually how complexity scales with
        the size of the input (the "{scalability}"), where the size of
        the input is described by some number N.  Thus an {algorithm}
        may have computational complexity O(N^2) (of the order of the
        square of the size of the input), in which case if the input
        doubles in size, the computation will take four times as many
        steps.  The ideal is a constant time algorithm (O(1)) or
        failing that, O(N).
     
        See also {NP-complete}.
