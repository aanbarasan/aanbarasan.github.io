      <WordDefinition>control-S vi. "Stop talking for a second." From the ASCII DC3 or XOFF
   character (the pronunciation /X-of/ is therefore also used). Control-S
   differs from {control-O} in that the person is asked to stop talking
   (perhaps because you are on the phone) but will be allowed to continue
   when you're ready to listen to him -- as opposed to control-O, which has
   more of the meaning of "Shut up." Considered silly.
