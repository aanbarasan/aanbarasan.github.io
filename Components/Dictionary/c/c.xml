      <WordDefinition>C
     
        &lt;language&gt; A programming language designed by {Dennis Ritchie}
        at {AT&amp;T} {Bell Labs} ca. 1972 for systems programming on the
        {PDP-11} and immediately used to reimplement {Unix}.
     
        It was called "C" because many features derived from an
        earlier compiler named "{B}".  In fact, C was briefly named
        "NB".  B was itself strongly influenced by {BCPL}.  Before
        {Bjarne Stroustrup} settled the question by designing {C++},
        there was a humorous debate over whether C's successor should
        be named "D" or "P" (following B and C in "BCPL").
     
        C is terse, low-level and permissive.  It has a {macro
        preprocessor}, {cpp}.
     
        Partly due to its distribution with {Unix}, C became immensely
        popular outside {Bell Labs} after about 1980 and is now the
        dominant language in systems and {microcomputer} applications
        programming.  It has grown popular due to its simplicity,
        efficiency, and flexibility.  C programs are often easily
        adapted to new environments.
     
        C is often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain,
        as "a language that combines all the elegance and power of
        {assembly language} with all the readability and
        maintainability of assembly language".
     
        Ritchie's original C, known as {K&amp;R C} after Kernighan and
        Ritchie's book, has been {standard}ised (and simultaneously
        modified) as {ANSI C}.

        superset of {ANSI C} with synchronous {semantics}, for the
        {Connection Machine}, designed by {Thinking Machines}, 1987.
        C* adds a "domain" data type and a selection statement for

      <WordDefinition>C+-
     
        &lt;language&gt; (C More or Less) A subject-oriented language (SOL).
        Each C+- {class} instance, known as a subject, holds hidden
        {members}, known as prejudices, agendas or undeclared
        preferences, which are impervious to outside messages; as well
        as public members, known as boasts or claims.
     
        The following {C} {operators} are overridden as shown:
     
         &gt;    better than
         &lt;    worse than
         &gt;&gt;   way better than
         &lt;&lt;   forget it
         !    not on your life
         ==   comparable, other things being equal
         !==  get a life, guy!
     
        C+- is {strongly typed}, based on stereotyping and
        self-righteous logic.  The {Boolean} {variables} TRUE and
        FALSE (known as constants in other, less realistic languages)
        are supplemented with CREDIBLE and DUBIOUS, which are fuzzier
        than Zadeh's traditional fuzzy categories.  All Booleans can
        be declared with the modifiers strong and weak.  Weak
        implication is said to "preserve deniability" and was added at
        the request of the DoD to ensure compatibility with future
        versions of {Ada}.  Well-formed falsehoods (WFFs) are
        {assignment}-compatible with all Booleans.  What-if and
        why-not interactions are aided by the special conditional
        EVENIFNOT X THEN Y.
     
        C+- supports {information hiding} and, among {friend classes}
        only, rumor sharing.  Borrowing from the {Eiffel} lexicon,
        non-friend classes can be killed by arranging contracts.  Note
        that friendships are {intransitive}, {volatile} and
        non-{Abelian}.
     
        {Operator precedence} rules can be suspended with the
        directive #pragma dwim, known as the "{Do what I mean}"
        {pragma}.
     
        {ANSIfication} will be firmly resisted. C+-'s slogan is "Be
        Your Own Standard."

      <WordDefinition>C++
     
        &lt;language&gt; One of the most used {object-oriented} languages, a
        superset of {C} developed primarily by {Bjarne Stroustrup}
        &lt;bs@alice.att.com&gt; at {AT&amp;T} {Bell Laboratories} in 1986.
     
        In C++ a {class} is a user-defined {type}, syntactically a
        {struct} with {member functions}.  {Constructors} and
        {destructors} are member functions called to create or destroy
        {instances}.  A {friend} is a nonmember function that is
        allowed to access the private portion of a class.  C++ allows
        {implicit type conversion}, {function inlining}, {overloading}
        of operators and function names, and {default function
        arguments}.  It has {streams} for I/O and {references}.
     
        C++ 2.0 (May 1989) introduced {multiple inheritance},
        {type-safe linkage}, pointers to members, and {abstract
        classes}.
     
        C++ 2.1 was introduced in ["Annotated C++ Reference Manual",
        B. Stroustrup et al, A-W 1990].

      <WordDefinition>C+@
     
        (Formerly Calico).  An {object-oriented language} from {Bell
        Laboratories} which uniformly represents all data as a pointer
        to a self-described object.  C+@ provides {multiple
        inheritance} with {delegation} and with control over which
        {method}s come from which delegated object; and {default
        methodologies}.  It has a simple {syntax} with emphasis on
        graphics.  It was originally used for prototyping of
        telecommunication services.
     
        {Unir Tech} has the exclusive license from Bell Labs to
        distribute C+@.  Unfortunately Unir is owned and operated by
        well-known anti-{IETF} ranter, Jim Fleming, which may have had
        something to do with the language's rapid disappearence from
        the radar screen.
     
        It runs under {SunOS} and compiles to {Vcode}.

      <WordDefinition>Gastropoda \Gas*trop"o*da\, n. pl., [NL., fr. Gr. ?, ?, stomach
   + -poda.] (Zo["o]l.)
   One of the classes of Mollusca, of great extent. It includes
   most of the marine spiral shells, and the land and
   fresh-water snails. They generally creep by means of a flat,
   muscular disk, or foot, on the ventral side of the body. The
   head usually bears one or two pairs of tentacles. See
   {Mollusca}. [Written also {Gasteropoda}.]
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The Gastropoda are divided into three subclasses; viz.:
         ({a}) The Streptoneura or Dioecia, including the
         Pectinibranchiata, Rhipidoglossa, Docoglossa, and
         Heteropoda. ({b}) The Euthyneura, including the
         Pulmonata and Opisthobranchia. ({c}) The Amphineura,
         including the Polyplacophora and Aplacophora.

      <WordDefinition>Language \Lan"guage\, n. [OE. langage, F. langage, fr. L. lingua
   the tongue, hence speech, language; akin to E. tongue. See
   {Tongue}, cf. {Lingual}.]
   [1913 Webster]
   1. Any means of conveying or communicating ideas;
      specifically, human speech; the expression of ideas by the
      voice; sounds, expressive of thought, articulated by the
      organs of the throat and mouth.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Language consists in the oral utterance of sounds which
         usage has made the representatives of ideas. When two
         or more persons customarily annex the same sounds to
         the same ideas, the expression of these sounds by one
         person communicates his ideas to another. This is the
         primary sense of language, the use of which is to
         communicate the thoughts of one person to another
         through the organs of hearing. Articulate sounds are
         represented to the eye by letters, marks, or
         characters, which form words.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. The expression of ideas by writing, or any other
      instrumentality.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. The forms of speech, or the methods of expressing ideas,
      peculiar to a particular nation.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. The characteristic mode of arranging words, peculiar to an
      individual speaker or writer; manner of expression; style.
      [1913 Webster]

            Others for language all their care express. --Pope.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. The inarticulate sounds by which animals inferior to man
      express their feelings or their wants.
      [1913 Webster]

   6. The suggestion, by objects, actions, or conditions, of
      ideas associated therewith; as, the language of flowers.
      [1913 Webster]

            There was . . . language in their very gesture.
                                                  --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   7. The vocabulary and phraseology belonging to an art or
      department of knowledge; as, medical language; the
      language of chemistry or theology.
      [1913 Webster]

   8. A race, as distinguished by its speech. [R.]
      [1913 Webster]

            All the people, the nations, and the languages, fell
            down and worshiped the golden image.  --Dan. iii. 7.
      [1913 Webster]

   9. Any system of symbols created for the purpose of
      communicating ideas, emotions, commands, etc., between
      sentient agents.
      [PJC]

   10. Specifically: (computers) Any set of symbols and the
       rules for combining them which are used to specify to a
       computer the actions that it is to take; also referred to
       as a {computer lanugage} or {programming language}; as,
       JAVA is a new and flexible high-level language which has
       achieved popularity very rapidly.
       [PJC]

   Note: Computer languages are classed a low-level if each
         instruction specifies only one operation of the
         computer, or high-level if each instruction may specify
         a complex combination of operations. {Machine language}
         and {assembly language} are low-level computer
         languages. {FORTRAN}, {COBOL} and {C} are high-level
         computer languages. Other computer languages, such as
         JAVA, allow even more complex combinations of low-level
         operations to be performed with a single command. Many
         programs, such as databases, are supplied with special
         languages adapted to manipulate the objects of concern
         for that specific program. These are also high-level
         languages.
         [PJC]

   {Language master}, a teacher of languages. [Obs.]

   Syn: Speech; tongue; idiom; dialect; phraseology; diction;
        discourse; conversation; talk.

   Usage: {Language}, {Speech}, {Tongue}, {Idiom}, {Dialect}.
          Language is generic, denoting, in its most extended
          use, any mode of conveying ideas; speech is the
          language of articulate sounds; tongue is the
          Anglo-Saxon term for language, esp. for spoken
          language; as, the English tongue. Idiom denotes the
          forms of construction peculiar to a particular
          language; dialects are varieties of expression which
          spring up in different parts of a country among people
          speaking substantially the same language.

      receives different names according to the manner in which
      it takes place; as: {(a)} Libration in longitude, that
      which, depending on the place of the moon in its elliptic
      orbit, causes small portions near the eastern and western
      borders alternately to appear and disappear each month.
      ({b}) Libration in latitude, that which depends on the
      varying position of the moon's axis in respect to the
      spectator, causing the alternate appearance and
      disappearance of either pole. ({c}) Diurnal or parallactic

   Note: The monkeys are often divided into three groups: ({a})
         {Catarrhines}, or {Simid[ae]}. These have an oblong
         head, with the oblique flat nostrils near together.
         Some have no tail, as the apes. All these are natives
         of the Old World. ({b}) {Platyrhines}, or {Cebid[ae]}.
         These have a round head, with a broad nasal septum, so
         that the nostrils are wide apart and directed downward.
         The tail is often prehensile, and the thumb is short

      <WordDefinition>C \C\ (s[=e])
   1. C is the third letter of the English alphabet. It is from
      the Latin letter C, which in old Latin represented the
      sounds of k, and g (in go); its original value being the
      latter. In Anglo-Saxon words, or Old English before the
      Norman Conquest, it always has the sound of k. The Latin C
      was the same letter as the Greek [Gamma], [gamma], and
      came from the Greek alphabet. The Greeks got it from the
      Ph[oe]nicians. The English name of C is from the Latin
      name ce, and was derived, probably, through the French.
      Etymologically C is related to g, h, k, q, s (and other
      sibilant sounds). Examples of these relations are in L.
      acutus, E. acute, ague; E. acrid, eager, vinegar; L.
      cornu, E. horn; E. cat, kitten; E. coy, quiet; L. circare,
      OF. cerchier, E. search.

          has neither flats nor sharps in its signature; also,
          the third note of the relative minor scale of the
          same.
      (b) C after the clef is the mark of common time, in which
          each measure is a semibreve (four fourths or
          crotchets); for alla breve time it is written ?.
      (c) The ``C clef,'' a modification of the letter C, placed
          on any line of the staff, shows that line to be middle
          C.
          [1913 Webster]

   3. As a numeral, C stands for Latin centum or 100, CC for
      200, etc.

      <WordDefinition>C++ /C'-pluhs-pluhs/ n. Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup of AT&amp;T Bell Labs
   as a successor to {C}. Now one of the {languages of choice}, although
   many hackers still grumble that it is the successor to either Algol 68
   or {Ada} (depending on generation), and a prime example of
   {second-system effect}. Almost anything that can be done in any language
   can be done in C++, but it requires a {language lawyer} to know what is
   and what is not legal-- the design is _almost_ too large to hold in even
   hackers' heads. Much of the {cruft} results from C++'s attempt to be
   backward compatible with C. Stroustrup himself has said in his
   retrospective book "The Design and Evolution of C++" (p. 207), "Within
   C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get
   out." [Many hackers would now add "Yes, and it's called {Java}" --ESR]

      <WordDefinition>C n. 1. The third letter of the English alphabet. 2. ASCII 1000011. 3.
   The name of a programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie during the
   early 1970s and immediately used to reimplement {{Unix}}; so called
   because many features derived from an earlier compiler named `B' in
   commemoration of _its_ parent, BCPL. (BCPL was in turn descended from an
   earlier Algol-derived language, CPL.) Before Bjarne Stroustrup settled
   the question by designing {C++}, there was a humorous debate over
   whether C's successor should be named `D' or `P'. C became immensely
   popular outside Bell Labs after about 1980 and is now the dominant
   language in systems and microcomputer applications programming. See also
   {languages of choice}, {indent style}.

   C is often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain varying
   according to the speaker, as "a language that combines all the elegance
   and power of assembly language with all the readability and
   maintainability of assembly language".
