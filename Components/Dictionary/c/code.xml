      <WordDefinition>code
     
        &lt;software&gt; Instructions for a computer in some programming
        language, often {machine language}.  The word "code" is often
        used to distinguish instructions from {data} (e.g. "The code
        is marked 'read-only'") whereas "{software}" is used in
        contrast with "{hardware}" and may consist of more than just
        code.

      <WordDefinition>code n. The stuff that software writers write, either in source form or
   after translation by a compiler or assembler. Often used in opposition
   to "data", which is the stuff that code operates on. This is a mass
   noun, as in "How much code does it take to do a {bubble sort}?", or "The
   code is loaded at the high end of RAM." Anyone referring to software as
   "the software codes" is probably a {newbie} or a {suit}.
