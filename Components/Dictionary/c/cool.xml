      <WordDefinition>COOL
     
        1. {Concurrent Object-Oriented Language}.
     
        2. CLIPS Object-Oriented Language?
     
        3. A C++ class library developed at {Texas Instruments}.  COOL
        contains a set of containers like Vectors, List, Hash_Table,
        etc.  It uses a shallow hierarchy with no common base class.
        The functionality is close to Common Lisp data structures
        (like libg++).  The template syntax is very close to Cfront3.x
        and g++2.x.  Can build shared libraries on Suns.
     
        JCOOL's main difference from COOL and GECOOL is that it uses
        real C++ templates instead of a similar syntax that is
        preprocessed by a special 'cpp' distributed with COOL and
        GECOOL.
