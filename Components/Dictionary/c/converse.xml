      <WordDefinition>Converse \Con"verse\, n.
   1. (Logic) A proposition which arises from interchanging the
      terms of another, as by putting the predicate for the
      subject, and the subject for the predicate; as, no virtue
      is vice, no vice is virtue.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: It should not (as is often done) be confounded with the
         contrary or opposite of a proposition, which is formed
         by introducing the negative not or no.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. (Math.) A proposition in which, after a conclusion from
      something supposed has been drawn, the order is inverted,
      making the conclusion the supposition or premises, what
      was first supposed becoming now the conclusion or
      inference. Thus, if two sides of a sides of a triangle are
      equal, the angles opposite the sides are equal; and the
      converse is true, i.e., if these angles are equal, the two
      sides are equal.
