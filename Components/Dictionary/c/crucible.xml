      <WordDefinition>Crucible \Cru"ci*ble\ (kr[udd]"s[i^]*b'l), n. [LL. crucibulum a
   hanging lamp, an earthen pot for melting metals (cf. OF.
   croisel, creuseul, sort of lamp, crucible, F. creuset
   crucible), prob. of German origin; cf. OHG. kr[=u]sul, LG.
   kr["u]sel, hanging lamp, kroos, kruus, mug, jug, jar, D.
   kroes cup, crucible, Dan. kruus, Sw. krus, E. cruse. It was
   confused with derivatives of L. crux cross (cf. {Crosslet}),
   and crucibles were said to have been marked with a cross, to
   prevent the devil from marring the chemical operation. See
   {Cruse}, and cf. {Cresset}.]
