   6. The collective body of senators and representatives of the
      people of a nation, esp. of a republic, constituting the
      chief legislative body of the nation.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In the Congress of the United States (which took the
         place of the Federal Congress, March 4, 1789), the
         Senate consists of two Senators from each State, chosen
         by the State legislature for a term of six years, in
         such a way that the terms of one third of the whole
         number expire every year; the House of Representatives
         consists of members elected by the people of the
         several Congressional districts, for a term of two
         years, the term of all ending at the same time. The
         united body of Senators and Representatives for any
         term of two years for which the whole body of
         Representatives is chosen is called one Congress. Thus
         the session which began in December, 1887, was the
         first (or long) session, and that which began in
         December, 1888, was the second (or short) session, of
         the Fiftieth Congress. When an extra session is had
         before the date of the first regular meeting of a
         Congress, that is called the first session, and the
         following regular session is called the second session.
         [1913 Webster]
