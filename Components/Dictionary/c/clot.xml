      <WordDefinition>Clot \Clot\ (kl[o^]t), n. [OE. clot, clodde, clod; akin to D.
   kloot ball, G. kloss clod, dumpling, klotz block, Dan. klods,
   Sw. klot bowl, globe, klots block; cf. AS. cl[=a]te bur. Cf.
   {Clod}, n., {Clutter} to clot.]
   A concretion or coagulation; esp. a soft, slimy, coagulated
   mass, as of blood; a coagulum. ``Clots of pory gore.''
   --Addison.

         Doth bake the egg into clots as if it began to poach.
                                                  --Bacon.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Clod and clot appear to be radically the same word, and
         are so used by early writers; but in present use clod
         is applied to a mass of earth or the like, and clot to
         a concretion or coagulation of soft matter.
