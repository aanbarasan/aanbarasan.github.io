      <WordDefinition>Cunning \Cun"ning\ (k[u^]n"n[i^]ng), a. [AS. cunnan to know, to
   be able. See 1st {Con}, {Can}.]
   1. Knowing; skillful; dexterous. ``A cunning workman.'' --
      Ex. xxxviii. 23.
      [1913 Webster]

            ``Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
            Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            Esau was a cunning hunter.            --Gen xxv. 27.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Wrought with, or exhibiting, skill or ingenuity;
      ingenious; curious; as, cunning work.
      [1913 Webster]

            Over them Arachne high did lift

            Her cunning web.                      --Spenser.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Crafty; sly; artful; designing; deceitful.
      [1913 Webster]

            They are resolved to be cunning; let others run the
            hazard of being sincere.              --South.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. Pretty or pleasing; as, a cunning little boy. [Colloq.
      U.S.] --Barlett.

   Syn: {Cunning}, {Artful}, {Sly}, {Wily}, {Crafty}.

   Usage: These epithets agree in expressing an aptitude for
          attaining some end by peculiar and secret means.
          Cunning is usually low; as, a cunning trick. Artful is
          more ingenious and inventive; as, an artful device.
          Sly implies a turn for what is double or concealed;
          as, sly humor; a sly evasion. Crafty denotes a talent
          for dexterously deceiving; as, a crafty manager. Wily
          describes a talent for the use of stratagems; as, a
          wily politician. ``Acunning man often shows his
          dexterity in simply concealing. An artful man goes
          further, and exerts his ingenuity in misleading. A
          crafty man mingles cunning with art, and so shapes his
          actions as to lull suspicions. The young may be
          cunning, but the experienced only can be crafty.
          Slyness is a vulgar kind of cunning; the sly man goes
          cautiously and silently to work. Wiliness is a species
          of cunning or craft applicable only to cases of attack
          and defense.'' --Crabb.
