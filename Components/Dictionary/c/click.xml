      <WordDefinition>click
     
        &lt;hardware&gt; To press and release a {button} on a {mouse} or
        other {pointing device}.  This generates an {event}, also
        specifying the screen position, which is processed by the
        {window manager} or {application program}.  On a mouse with
        more than one button, the unqualified term usually implies
        pressing the left-most button (with the right index finger),
        other buttons would be qualified, e.g. "{right-click}".
        {Keyboard} modifiers may also be used, e.g. "shift-click",
        meaning to hold down the shift key on the keyboard while
        clicking the mouse button.
     
        If the mouse moves while the button is pressed then this is a
        {drag}.
