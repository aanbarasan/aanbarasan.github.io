   Note: The typical galley of the Mediterranean was from one
         hundred to two hundred feet long, often having twenty
         oars on each side. It had two or three masts rigged
         with lateen sails, carried guns at prow and stern, and
         a complement of one thousand to twelve hundred men, and
         was very efficient in mediaeval warfare. Galleons,
         galliots, galleasses, half galleys, and quarter galleys
         were all modifications of this type.
