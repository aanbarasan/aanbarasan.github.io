      <WordDefinition>Canon
   This word is derived from a Hebrew and Greek word denoting a
   reed or cane. Hence it means something straight, or something to
   keep straight; and hence also a rule, or something ruled or
   measured. It came to be applied to the Scriptures, to denote
   that they contained the authoritative rule of faith and
   practice, the standard of doctrine and duty. A book is said to
   be of canonical authority when it has a right to take a place
   with the other books which contain a revelation of the Divine
   will. Such a right does not arise from any ecclesiastical
   authority, but from the evidence of the inspired authorship of
   the book. The canonical (i.e., the inspired) books of the Old
   and New Testaments, are a complete rule, and the only rule, of
   faith and practice. They contain the whole supernatural
   revelation of God to men. The New Testament Canon was formed
   gradually under divine guidance. The different books as they
   were written came into the possession of the Christian
   associations which began to be formed soon after the day of
   Pentecost; and thus slowly the canon increased till all the
   books were gathered together into one collection containing the
   whole of the twenty-seven New Testament inspired books.
   Historical evidence shows that from about the middle of the
   second century this New Testament collection was substantially
   such as we now possess. Each book contained in it is proved to
   have, on its own ground, a right to its place; and thus the
   whole is of divine authority.
   
     The Old Testament Canon is witnessed to by the New Testament
   writers. Their evidence is conclusive. The quotations in the New
   from the Old are very numerous, and the references are much more
   numerous. These quotations and references by our Lord and the
   apostles most clearly imply the existence at that time of a
   well-known and publicly acknowledged collection of Hebrew
   writings under the designation of "The Scriptures;" "The Law and
   the Prophets and the Psalms;" "Moses and the Prophets," etc. The
   appeals to these books, moreover, show that they were regarded
   as of divine authority, finally deciding all questions of which
   they treat; and that the whole collection so recognized
   consisted only of the thirty-nine books which we now posses.
   Thus they endorse as genuine and authentic the canon of the
   Jewish Scriptures. The Septuagint Version (q.v.) also contained
   every book we now have in the Old Testament Scriptures. As to
   the time at which the Old Testament canon was closed, there are
   many considerations which point to that of Ezra and Nehemiah,
   immediately after the return from Babylonian exile. (See BIBLE
   ï¿½T0000580, {EZRA}, {QUOTATIONS}.)
