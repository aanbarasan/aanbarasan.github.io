      <WordDefinition>Carve
   The arts of engraving and carving were much practised among the
   Jews. They were practised in connection with the construction of
   the tabernacle and the temple (Ex. 31:2, 5; 35:33; 1 Kings 6:18,
   35; Ps. 74:6), as well as in the ornamentation of the priestly
   dresses (Ex. 28:9-36; Zech. 3:9; 2 Chr. 2:7, 14). Isaiah
   (44:13-17) gives a minute description of the process of carving
   idols of wood.
