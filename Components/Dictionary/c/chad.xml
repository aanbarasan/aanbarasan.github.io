        &lt;jargon, printer&gt; /chad/ (Or "selvage" /sel'v*j/ (sewing and
        weaving), "{perf}", "perfory", "snaf").  1. The perforated
        edge strips on paper for {sprocket feed} printers, after they
        have been separated from the printed portion.
     
        The term {perf} may also refer to the perforations themselves,
        rather than the chad they produce when torn.
     
        [Why "snaf"?]
     
        2. (Or "chaff", "computer confetti", "keypunch droppings") The
        confetti-like bits punched out of {punched cards} or {paper
        tape} which collected in the {chad box}.
     
        One of the {Jargon File}'s correspondents believed that "chad"
        derived from the {chadless keypunch}.

      <WordDefinition>Shad \Shad\ (sh[a^]d), n. sing. &amp; pl. [AS. sceadda a kind of
   fish, akin to Prov. G. schade; cf. Ir. &amp; Gael. sgadan a
   herring, W. ysgadan herrings; all perhaps akin to E. skate a
   fish.] (Zo["o]l.)
   Any one of several species of food fishes of the Herring
   family. The American species ({Alosa sapidissima} formerly
   {Clupea sapidissima}), which is abundant on the Atlantic
   coast and ascends the larger rivers in spring to spawn, is an
   important market fish. The European allice shad, or alose
   ({Alosa alosa} formerly {Clupea alosa}), and the twaite shad
   ({Alosa finta} formerly {Clupea finta}), are less important
   species. [Written also {chad}.]
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The name is loosely applied, also, to several other
         fishes, as the gizzard shad (see under {Gizzard}),
         called also {mud shad}, {white-eyed shad}, and {winter
         shad}.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Hardboaded shad}, or {Yellow-tailed shad}, the menhaden.

   {Hickory shad}, or {Tailor shad}, the {mattowacca}.

   {Long-boned shad}, one of several species of important food
      fishes of the Bermudas and the West Indies, of the genus
      {Gerres}.

   {Shad bush} (Bot.), a name given to the North American shrubs
      or small trees of the rosaceous genus {Amelanchier} ({A.
      Canadensis}, and {A. alnifolia}) Their white racemose
      blossoms open in April or May, when the shad appear, and
      the edible berries (pomes) ripen in June or July, whence
      they are called Juneberries. The plant is also called
      {service tree}, and {Juneberry}.

   {Shad frog}, an American spotted frog ({Rana halecina}); --
      so called because it usually appears at the time when the
      shad begin to run in the rivers.

   {Trout shad}, the squeteague.

   {White shad}, the common shad.

      <WordDefinition>chad /chad/ n. 1. [common] The perforated edge strips on printer paper,
   after they have been separated from the printed portion. Also called
   {selvage}, {perf}, and {ripoff}. 2. The confetti-like paper bits punched
   out of cards or paper tape; this has also been called `chaff', `computer
   confetti', and `keypunch droppings'. It's reported that this was very
   old Army slang (associated with teletypewriters before the computer
   era), and has been occasionally sighted in directions for punched-card
   vote tabulators long after it passed out of live use among computer
   programmers in the late 1970s. This sense of `chad' returned to the
   mainstream during the finale of the hotly disputed U.S. presidential
   election in 2000 via stories about the Florida vote recounts. Note
   however that in the revived mainstream usage chad is not a mass noun and
   `a chad' is a single piece of the stuff.

   There is an urban legend that `chad' (sense 2) derives from the
   Chadless keypunch (named for its inventor), which cut little u-shaped
   tabs in the card to make a hole when the tab folded back, rather than
   punching out a circle/rectangle; it was clear that if the Chadless
   keypunch didn't make them, then the stuff that other keypunches made had
   to be `chad'. However, serious attempts to track down "Chadless" as a
   personal name or U.S. trademark have failed, casting doubt on this
   etymology - and the U.S. Patent Classification System uses "chadless"
   (small c) as an adjective, suggesting that "chadless" derives from
   "chad" and not the other way around. There is another legend that the
   word was originally acronymic, standing for "Card Hole Aggregate
   Debris", but this has all the earmarks of a {backronym}. It has also
   been noted that the word "chad" is Scots dialect for gravel, but nobody
   has proposed any plausible reason that card chaff should be thought of
   as gravel. None of these etymologies is really plausible.

   Introduction Chad
   -----------------
                            Background: Chad, part of France's African
                                        holdings until 1960, endured three
                                        decades of ethnic warfare as well as
                                        invasions by Libya before a
                                        semblance of peace was finally
                                        restored in 1990. The government
                                        eventually suppressed or came to
                                        terms with most political-military
                                        groups, settled a territorial
                                        dispute with Libya on terms
                                        favorable to Chad, drafted a
                                        democratic constitution, and held
                                        multiparty presidential and National
                                        Assembly elections in 1996 and 1997
                                        respectively. In 1998 a new
                                        rebellion broke out in northern
                                        Chad, which continued to escalate
                                        throughout 2000. A peace agreement,
                                        signed in January 2002 between the
                                        government and the rebels, provides
                                        for the demobilization of the rebels
                                        and their reintegration into the
                                        political system. Despite movement
                                        toward democratic reform, power
                                        remains in the hands of a northern
                                        ethnic oligarchy.

   Economy Chad
   ------------
                    Economy - overview: Chad's primarily agricultural
                                        economy will be boosted by major
                                        oilfield and pipeline projects that
                                        began in 2000. Over 80% of Chad's
                                        population relies on subsistence
                                        farming and stock raising for their
                                        livelihood. Cotton, cattle, and gum
                                        arabic provide the bulk of Chad's
                                        export earnings, but Chad will begin
                                        to export oil in 2004. Chad's
                                        economy has long been handicapped by
                                        its land-locked position, high
                                        energy costs, and a history of
                                        instability. Chad relies on foreign
                                        assistance and foreign capital for
                                        most public and private sector
                                        investment projects. A consortium
                                        led by two US companies is investing
                                        $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves
                                        estimated at 1 billion barrels in
                                        southern Chad.
