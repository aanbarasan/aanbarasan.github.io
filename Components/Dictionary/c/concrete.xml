      <WordDefinition>Concrete \Con*crete"\, v. i. [imp. &amp; p. p. {Concreted}; p. pr &amp;
   vb. n. {Concreting}.]
   To unite or coalesce, as separate particles, into a mass or
   solid body.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Applied to some substances, it is equivalent to
         indurate; as, metallic matter concretes into a hard
         body; applied to others, it is equivalent to congeal,
         thicken, inspissate, coagulate, as in the concretion of
         blood. ``The blood of some who died of the plague could
         not be made to concrete.'' --Arbuthnot.

      <WordDefinition>Concrete \Con"crete\ (? or ?), a. [L. concretus, p. p. of
   concrescere to grow together; con- + crescere to grow; cf. F.
   concret. See {Crescent}.]
   1. United in growth; hence, formed by coalition of separate
      particles into one mass; united in a solid form.
      [1913 Webster]

            The first concrete state, or consistent surface, of
            the chaos must be of the same figure as the last
            liquid state.                         --Bp. Burnet.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Logic)
      (a) Standing for an object as it exists in nature,
          invested with all its qualities, as distinguished from
          standing for an attribute of an object; -- opposed to
          {abstract}. Hence:
      (b) Applied to a specific object; special; particular; --
          opposed to {general}. See {Abstract}, 3.
          [1913 Webster]

                Concrete is opposed to abstract. The names of
                individuals are concrete, those of classes
                abstract.                         --J. S. Mill.
          [1913 Webster]

                Concrete terms, while they express the quality,
                do also express, or imply, or refer to, some
                subject to which it belongs.      --I. Watts.
          [1913 Webster]

   {Concrete number}, a number associated with, or applied to, a
      particular object, as three men, five days, etc., as
      distinguished from an abstract number, or one used without
      reference to a particular object.

   {Concrete quantity}, a physical object or a collection of
      such objects. --Davies &amp; Peck.

   {Concrete science}, a physical science, one having as its
      subject of knowledge concrete things instead of abstract
      laws.

   {Concrete sound or movement of the voice}, one which slides
      continuously up or down, as distinguished from a
      {discrete} movement, in which the voice leaps at once from
      one line of pitch to another. --Rush.

      union, or coalescence of separate particles of matter in

      [1913 Webster]

            To divide all concretes, minerals and others, into
            the same number of distinct substances. --Boyle.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. A mixture of gravel, pebbles, or broken stone with cement
      or with tar, etc., used for sidewalks, roadways,
      foundations, etc., and esp. for submarine structures.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. (Logic) A term designating both a quality and the subject
      in which it exists; a concrete term.
      [1913 Webster]

            The concretes ``father'' and ``son'' have, or might
            have, the abstracts ``paternity'' and ``filiety''.
                                                  --J. S. Mill.
      [1913 Webster]

      solid mass.
