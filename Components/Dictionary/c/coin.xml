      <WordDefinition>Coin
   Before the Exile the Jews had no regularly stamped money. They
   made use of uncoined shekels or talents of silver, which they
   weighed out (Gen. 23:16; Ex. 38:24; 2 Sam. 18:12). Probably the
   silver ingots used in the time of Abraham may have been of a
   fixed weight, which was in some way indicated on them. The
   "pieces of silver" paid by Abimelech to Abraham (Gen. 20:16),
   and those also for which Joseph was sold (37:28), were proably
   in the form of rings. The shekel was the common standard of
   weight and value among the Hebrews down to the time of the
   Captivity. Only once is a shekel of gold mentioned (1 Chr.
   21:25). The "six thousand of gold" mentioned in the transaction
   between Naaman and Gehazi (2 Kings 5:5) were probably so many
   shekels of gold. The "piece of money" mentioned in Job 42:11;
   Gen. 33:19 (marg., "lambs") was the Hebrew _kesitah_, probably
   an uncoined piece of silver of a certain weight in the form of a
   sheep or lamb, or perhaps having on it such an impression. The
   same Hebrew word is used in Josh. 24:32, which is rendered by
   Wickliffe "an hundred yonge scheep."
