        1. &lt;programming&gt; {switch statement}.
     
        2. &lt;character&gt; Whether a character is a capital letter ("upper
        case" - ABC..Z) or a small letter ("lower case" - abc..z).
     
        The term case comes from the printing trade when the use of
        moving type was invented in the early Middle Ages (Caxton or
        Gutenberg?) and the letters for each {font} were stored in a
        box with two sections (or "cases"), the upper case was for the
        capital letters and the lower case was for the small letters.
        The Oxford Universal Dictionary of Historical Principles (Feb
        1993, reprinted 1952) indicates that this usage of "case" (as
        the box or frame used by a compositor in the printing trade)
        was first used in 1588.

            Let us consider the reason of the case, for nothing

                                                  Powell.

   5. (Gram.) One of the forms, or the inflections or changes of

      sustains to some other word.
      [1913 Webster]

            Case is properly a falling off from the nominative
            or first state of word; the name for which, however,
            is now, by extension of its signification, applied
            also to the nominative.               --J. W. Gibbs.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Cases other than the nominative are oblique cases. Case
         endings are terminations by which certain cases are
         distinguished. In old English, as in Latin, nouns had
         several cases distinguished by case endings, but in
         modern English only that of the possessive case is
         retained.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Action on the case} (Law), according to the old
      classification (now obsolete), was an action for redress
      of wrongs or injuries to person or property not specially
      provided against by law, in which the whole cause of
      complaint was set out in the writ; -- called also

      a decision of the legal points arising on them.

   {A hard case}, an abandoned or incorrigible person. [Colloq.]
      

   {In any case}, whatever may be the state of affairs; anyhow.
      

   {In case}, or {In case that}, if; supposing that; in the
      event or contingency; if it should happen that. ``In case
      we are surprised, keep by me.'' --W. Irving.

   {In good case}, in good condition, health, or state of body.
      

   {To put a case}, to suppose a hypothetical or illustrative
      case.
