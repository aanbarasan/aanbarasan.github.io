   4. To plan; to expect; to think. [Local, U. S.]

   Syn: To compute; reckon; count; estimate; rate.

   Usage: {To Calculate}, {Compute}. {Reckon}, {Count}. These
          words indicate the means by which we arrive at a given
          result in regard to quantity. We calculate with a view
          to obtain a certain point of knowledge; as, to
          calculate an eclipse. We compute by combining given
          numbers, in order to learn the grand result. We reckon
          and count in carrying out the details of a
          computation. These words are also used in a secondary
          and figurative sense. ``Calculate is rather a
          conjection from what is, as to what may be;
          computation is a rational estimate of what has been,
          from what is; reckoning is a conclusive conviction, a
          pleasing assurance that a thing will happen; counting
          indicates an expectation. We calculate on a gain; we
          compute any loss sustained, or the amount of any
          mischief done; we reckon on a promised pleasure; we
          count the hours and minutes until the time of
          enjoyment arrives'' --Crabb.
