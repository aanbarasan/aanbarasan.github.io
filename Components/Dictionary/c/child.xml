      <WordDefinition>Child
   This word has considerable latitude of meaning in Scripture.
   Thus Joseph is called a child at the time when he was probably
   about sixteen years of age (Gen. 37:3); and Benjamin is so
   called when he was above thirty years (44:20). Solomon called
   himself a little child when he came to the kingdom (1 Kings
   3:7).
   
     The descendants of a man, however remote, are called his
   children; as, "the children of Edom," "the children of Moab,"
   "the children of Israel."
   
     In the earliest times mothers did not wean their children till
   they were from thirty months to three years old; and the day on
   which they were weaned was kept as a festival day (Gen. 21:8;
   Ex. 2:7, 9; 1 Sam. 1:22-24; Matt. 21:16). At the age of five,
   children began to learn the arts and duties of life under the
   care of their fathers (Deut. 6:20-25; 11:19).
   
     To have a numerous family was regarded as a mark of divine
   favour (Gen. 11:30; 30:1; 1 Sam. 2:5; 2 Sam. 6:23; Ps. 127:3;
   128:3).
   
     Figuratively the name is used for those who are ignorant or
   narrow-minded (Matt. 11:16; Luke 7:32; 1 Cor. 13:11). "When I
   was a child, I spake as a child." "Brethren, be not children in
   understanding" (1 Cor. 14:20). "That we henceforth be no more
   children, tossed to and fro" (Eph. 4:14).
   
     Children are also spoken of as representing simplicity and
   humility (Matt. 19:13-15; Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17).
   Believers are "children of light" (Luke 16:8; 1 Thess. 5:5) and
   "children of obedience" (1 Pet. 1:14).
