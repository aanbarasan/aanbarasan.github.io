      <WordDefinition>Cave
   There are numerous natural caves among the limestone rocks of
   Syria, many of which have been artificially enlarged for various
   purposes.
   
     The first notice of a cave occurs in the history of Lot (Gen.
   19:30).
   
     The next we read of is the cave of Machpelah (q.v.), which
   Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth (Gen. 25:9, 10). It was
   the burying-place of Sarah and of Abraham himself, also of
   Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob (Gen. 49:31; 50:13).
   
     The cave of Makkedah, into which the five Amorite kings
   retired after their defeat by Joshua (10:16, 27).
   
     The cave of Adullam (q.v.), an immense natural cavern, where
   David hid himself from Saul (1 Sam. 22:1, 2).
   
     The cave of Engedi (q.v.), now called 'Ain Jidy, i.e., the
   "Fountain of the Kid", where David cut off the skirt of Saul's
   robe (24:4). Here he also found a shelter for himself and his
   followers to the number of 600 (23:29; 24:1). "On all sides the
   country is full of caverns which might serve as lurking-places
   for David and his men, as they do for outlaws at the present
   day."
   
     The cave in which Obadiah hid the prophets (1 Kings 18:4) was
   probably in the north, but it cannot be identified.
   
     The cave of Elijah (1 Kings 19:9), and the "cleft" of Moses on
   Horeb (Ex. 33:22), cannot be determined.
   
     In the time of Gideon the Israelites took refuge from the
   Midianites in dens and caves, such as abounded in the mountain
   regions of Manasseh (Judg. 6:2).
   
     Caves were frequently used as dwelling-places (Num. 24:21;
   Cant. 2:14; Jer. 49:16; Obad. 1:3). "The excavations at Deir
   Dubban, on the south side of the wady leading to Santa Hanneh,
   are probably the dwellings of the Horites," the ancient
   inhabitants of Idumea Proper. The pits or cavities in rocks were
   also sometimes used as prisons (Isa. 24:22; 51:14; Zech. 9:11).
   Those which had niches in their sides were occupied as
   burying-places (Ezek. 32:23; John 11:38).
