   [imp. &amp; p. p. {Communicated}; p. pr. &amp; vb. n.
   {Communicating}.] [L. communicatus, p. p. of communicare to

   Syn: To impart; bestow; confer; reveal; disclose; tell;
        announce; recount; make known.

   Usage: To {Communicate}, {Impart}, {Reveal}. Communicate is
          the more general term, and denotes the allowing of
          others to partake or enjoy in common with ourselves.
          Impart is more specific. It is giving to others a part
          of what we had held as our own, or making them our
          partners; as, to impart our feelings; to impart of our
          property, etc. Hence there is something more intimate
          in imparting intelligence than in communicating it. To
          reveal is to disclose something hidden or concealed;
          as, to reveal a secret.
          [1913 Webster]
