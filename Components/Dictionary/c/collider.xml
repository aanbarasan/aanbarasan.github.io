      <WordDefinition>collider \col*lid"er\ n. (Physics)
   a particle accelerator in which two separate beams of
   particles (usually of opposite charge) are circulated in
   opposite directions and directed so as to collide head on.
   This technique allows the production of collisions of higher
   energy than would be possible with a single beam produced by
   the same device.

   Syn: particle collider; colliding-beam accelerator;
        colliding-beam machine. [WordNet 1.5 +PJC]
