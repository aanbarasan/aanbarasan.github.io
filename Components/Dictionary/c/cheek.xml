      <WordDefinition>Cheek
   Smiting on the cheek was accounted a grievous injury and insult
   (Job 16:10; Lam. 3:30; Micah 5:1). The admonition (Luke 6:29),
   "Unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
   other," means simply, "Resist not evil" (Matt. 5:39; 1 Pet.
   2:19-23). Ps. 3:7 = that God had deprived his enemies of the
   power of doing him injury.
