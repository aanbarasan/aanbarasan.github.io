      <WordDefinition>current
     
        &lt;electronics&gt; The quantity of {charge} per unit time, measured
        in Amperes (Amps, A).  By historical convention, the sign of
        current is positive for currents flowing from positive to
        negative {potential}, but experience indicates that electrons
        are negatively charged and flow in the opposite direction.
