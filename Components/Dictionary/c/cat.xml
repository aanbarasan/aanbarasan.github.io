      <WordDefinition>cat
     
        &lt;tool&gt; (From "catenate") {Unix}'s command which copies one or
        more entire files to the screen or some other output sink
        without pause.
     
        See also {dd}, {BLT}.
     
        Among {Unix} fans, cat is considered an excellent example of
        user-interface design, because it delivers the file contents
        without such verbosity as spacing or headers between the files
        (the {pr} command can be used to do this), and because it does
        not require the files to consist of lines of text, but works
        with any sort of data.
     
        Among Unix haters, cat is considered the {canonical} example
        of *bad* user-interface design, because of its woefully
        unobvious name.  It is far more often used to {blast} a file
        to standard output than to concatenate files.  The name "cat"
        for the former operation is just as unintuitive as, say,
        LISP's {cdr}.
     
        Of such oppositions are {holy wars} made.

      <WordDefinition>cat \cat\ (k[a^]t), n. [AS. cat; akin to D. &amp; Dan. kat, Sw.
   katt, Icel. k["o]ttr, G. katze, kater, Ir. cat, W. cath,
   Armor. kaz, LL. catus, Bisc. catua, NGr. ga`ta, ga`tos, Russ.
   &amp; Pol. kot, Turk. kedi, Ar. qitt; of unknown origin. Cf.
   {Kitten}.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) Any animal belonging to the natural family
      {Felidae}, and in particular to the various species of the
      genera {Felis}, {Panthera}, and {Lynx}. The domestic cat
      is {Felis domestica}. The European wild cat ({Felis
      catus}) is much larger than the domestic cat. In the
      United States the name {wild cat} is commonly applied to
      the bay lynx ({Lynx rufus}). The larger felines, such as
      the lion, tiger, leopard, and cougar, are often referred
      to as cats, and sometimes as big cats. See {Wild cat}, and
      {Tiger cat}.
      [1913 Webster +PJC]

   Note: The domestic cat includes many varieties named from
         their place of origin or from some peculiarity; as, the
         {Angora cat}; the {Maltese cat}; the {Manx cat}; the
         {Siamese cat}.
         [1913 Webster]

               Laying aside their often rancorous debate over
               how best to preserve the {Florida panther}, state
               and federal wildlife officials,
               environmentalists, and independent scientists
               endorsed the proposal, and in 1995 the eight cats
               [female Texas cougars] were brought from Texas
               and released. . . .
               Uprooted from the arid hills of West Texas, three
               of the imports have died, but the remaining five
               adapted to swamp life and have each given birth
               to at least one litter of kittens. --Mark Derr
                                                  (N. Y. Times,
                                                  Nov. 2, 1999,
                                                  Science Times
                                                  p. F2).
         [PJC]

   Note: The word cat is also used to designate other animals,
         from some fancied resemblance; as, civet cat, fisher
         cat, catbird, catfish shark, sea cat.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. (Naut.)
      (a) A strong vessel with a narrow stern, projecting
          quarters, and deep waist. It is employed in the coal
          and timber trade.
      (b) A strong tackle used to draw an anchor up to the
          cathead of a ship. --Totten.
          [1913 Webster]

   3. A double tripod (for holding a plate, etc.), having six
      feet, of which three rest on the ground, in whatever
      position it is placed.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. An old game; specifically:
      (a) The game of tipcat and the implement with which it is
          played. See {Tipcat}.
      (b) A game of ball, called, according to the number of
          batters, one old cat, two old cat, etc.
          [1913 Webster]

   5. same as {cat o' nine tails}; as, British sailors feared
      the cat.
      [1913 Webster + WordNet 1.5]

   6. A {catamaran}.
      [PJC]

   {Angora cat}, {blind cat}, See under {Angora}, {Blind}.

   {Cat's cradle}, game played, esp. by children, with a string
      looped on the fingers so, as to resemble small cradle. The
      string is transferred from the fingers of one to those of
      another, at each transfer with a change of form. See
      {Cratch}, {Cratch cradle}.

   {To bell the cat}, to perform a very dangerous or very
      difficult task; -- taken metaphorically from a fable about
      a mouse who proposes to put a bell on a cat, so as to be
      able to hear the cat coming.

      or willfully. [Colloq.]

      <WordDefinition>cat [from `catenate' via {{Unix}} `cat(1)'] vt. 1. [techspeak] To spew
   an entire file to the screen or some other output sink without pause
   (syn. {blast}). 2. By extension, to dump large amounts of data at an
   unprepared target or with no intention of browsing it carefully. Usage:
   considered silly. Rare outside Unix sites. See also {dd}, {BLT}.

   Among Unix fans, `cat(1)' is considered an excellent example of
   user-interface design, because it delivers the file contents without
   such verbosity as spacing or headers between the files, and because it
   does not require the files to consist of lines of text, but works with
   any sort of data.

   Among Unix haters, `cat(1)' is considered the {canonical} example of
   _bad_ user-interface design, because of its woefully unobvious name. It
   is far more often used to {blast} a file to standard output than to
   concatenate two files. The name `cat' for the former operation is just
   as unintuitive as, say, LISP's {cdr}.

   Of such oppositions are {holy wars} made.... See also {UUOC}.
