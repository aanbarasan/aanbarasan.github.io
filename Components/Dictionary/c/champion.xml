      <WordDefinition>Champion
   (1 Sam. 17:4, 23), properly "the man between the two," denoting
   the position of Goliath between the two camps. Single combats of
   this kind at the head of armies were common in ancient times. In
   ver. 51 this word is the rendering of a different Hebrew word,
   and properly denotes "a mighty man."
