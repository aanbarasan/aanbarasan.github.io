      <WordDefinition>CURSE, v.t.  Energetically to belabor with a verbal slap-stick.  This
is an operation which in literature, particularly in the drama, is
commonly fatal to the victim.  Nevertheless, the liability to a
cursing is a risk that cuts but a small figure in fixing the rates of
life insurance.

      <WordDefinition>Curse
   denounced by God against the serpent (Gen. 3:14), and against
   Cain (4:11). These divine maledictions carried their effect with
   them. Prophetical curses were sometimes pronounced by holy men
   (Gen. 9:25; 49:7; Deut. 27:15; Josh. 6:26). Such curses are not
   the consequence of passion or revenge, they are predictions.
   
     No one on pain of death shall curse father or mother (Ex.
   21:17), nor the prince of his people (22:28), nor the deaf (Lev.
   19:14). Cursing God or blaspheming was punishable by death (Lev.
   24:10-16). The words "curse God and die" (R.V., "renounce God
   and die"), used by Job's wife (Job 2:9), have been variously
   interpreted. Perhaps they simply mean that as nothing but death
   was expected, God would by this cursing at once interpose and
   destroy Job, and so put an end to his sufferings.
