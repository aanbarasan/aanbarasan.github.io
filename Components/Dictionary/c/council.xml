      <WordDefinition>Council
   spoken of counsellors who sat in public trials with the governor
   of a province (Acts 25:12).
   
     The Jewish councils were the Sanhedrim, or supreme council of
   the nation, which had subordinate to it smaller tribunals (the
   "judgment," perhaps, in Matt. 5:21, 22) in the cities of
   Palestine (Matt. 10:17; Mark 13:9). In the time of Christ the
   functions of the Sanhedrim were limited (John 16:2; 2 Cor.
   11:24). In Ps. 68:27 the word "council" means simply a company
   of persons. (R.V. marg., "company.")
   
     In ecclesiastical history the word is used to denote an
   assembly of pastors or bishops for the discussion and regulation
   of church affairs. The first of these councils was that of the
   apostles and elders at Jerusalem, of which we have a detailed
   account in Acts 15.
