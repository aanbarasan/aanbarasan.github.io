      <WordDefinition>computer
     
        &lt;computer&gt; A machine that can be programmed to manipulate
        symbols.  Computers can perform complex and repetitive
        procedures quickly, precisely and reliably and can quickly
        store and retrieve large amounts of data.
     
        The physical components from which a computer is constructed
        (electronic circuits and input/output devices) are known as
        "{hardware}".  Most computers have four types of hardware
        component: CPU, input, output and memory.  The CPU ({central
        processing unit}) executes programs ("{software}") which tell
        the computer what to do.  Input and output (I/O) devices allow
        the computer to communicate with the user and the outside
        world.  There are several kinds of memory - fast, expensive,
        short term memory (e.g. {RAM}) to hold intermediate results,
        and slower, cheaper, long-term memory (e.g. {magnetic disk} and
        {magnetic tape}) to hold programs and data between jobs.
     
        See also {analogue computer}.

      <WordDefinition>Computer \Com*put"er\ (k[o^]m*p[=u]t"[~e]r), n.
   1. One who computes.

   2. (Computers) an electronic device for performing
      calculations automatically. It consists of a clock to
      provide voltage pulses to synchronize the operations of
      the devices within the computer, a central processing
      unit, where the arithmetical and logical operations are
      performed on data, a random-access memory, where the
      programs and data are stored for rapid access, devices to
      input data and output results, and various other
      peripheral devices of widely varied function, as well as
      circuitry to support the main operations.

   Note: This modern sense of computer comprises the
         stored-program computers, in which multiple steps in a
         calculation may be stored within the computer itself as
         {instructions} in a {program}, and are then executed by
         the computer without further intervention of the
         operator. Different types of computer are variously
         called {analog computer}, {number cruncher,
         number-cruncher}, {digital computer}, and {pari-mutuel
         machine, totalizer, totaliser, totalizator,
         totalisator}.

   Syn: data processor, electronic computer, information
        processing system.
        [WordNet 1.5 +PJC]

   3. (Computers) same as {digital computer}.

      <WordDefinition>electronic device \electronic device\ n.
   a device depending on the principles of electronics and using
   the manipulation of electron flow for its operation.
   [PJC]

   Note: Numerous electronic devices are in daily use, among
         them the {television}, {radio}, {computer}, {robot},
         {transmitter}, {receiver}, {VCR}, {CD player}, etc.
