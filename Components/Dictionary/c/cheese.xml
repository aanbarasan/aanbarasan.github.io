      <WordDefinition>Cheese
   (A.S. cese). This word occurs three times in the Authorized
   Version as the translation of three different Hebrew words: (1.)
   1 Sam. 17:18, "ten cheeses;" i.e., ten sections of curd. (2.) 2
   Sam. 17:29, "cheese of kine" = perhaps curdled milk of kine. The
   Vulgate version reads "fat calves." (3.) Job 10:10, curdled milk
   is meant by the word.
