      <WordDefinition>Contest \Con"test\, n.
   1. Earnest dispute; strife in argument; controversy; debate;
      altercation.
      [1913 Webster]

            Leave all noisy contests, all immodest clamors and
            brawling language.                    --I. Watts.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Earnest struggle for superiority, victory, defense, etc.;
      competition; emulation; strife in arms; conflict; combat;
      encounter.
      [1913 Webster]

            The late battle had, in effect, been a contest
            between one usurper and another.      --Hallam.
      [1913 Webster]

            It was fully expected that the contest there would
            be long and fierce.                   --Macaulay.

   Syn: Conflict; combat; battle; encounter; shock; struggle;
        dispute; altercation; debate; controvesy; difference;
        disagreement; strife.

   Usage: {Contest}, {Conflict}, {Combat}, {Encounter}. Contest
          is the broadest term, and had originally no reference
          to actual fighting. It was, on the contrary, a legal
          term signifying to call witnesses, and hence came to
          denote first a struggle in argument, and then a
          struggle for some common object between opposing
          parties, usually one of considerable duration, and
          implying successive stages or acts. Conflict denotes
          literally a close personal engagement, in which sense
          it is applied to actual fighting. It is, however, more
          commonly used in a figurative sense to denote
          strenuous or direct opposition; as, a mental conflict;
          conflicting interests or passions; a conflict of laws.
          An encounter is a direct meeting face to face. Usually
          it is a hostile meeting, and is then very nearly
          coincident with conflict; as, an encounter of opposing
          hosts. Sometimes it is used in a looser sense; as,
          ``this keen encounter of our wits.'' --Shak. Combat is
          commonly applied to actual fighting, but may be used
          figuratively in reference to a strife or words or a
          struggle of feeling.
