      <WordDefinition>Candle
   Heb. ner, Job 18:6; 29:3; Ps. 18:28; Prov. 24:20, in all which
   places the Revised Version and margin of Authorized Version have
   "lamp," by which the word is elsewhere frequently rendered. The
   Hebrew word denotes properly any kind of candle or lamp or
   torch. It is used as a figure of conscience (Prov. 20:27), of a
   Christian example (Matt. 5:14, 15), and of prosperity (Job
   21:17; Prov. 13:9).
