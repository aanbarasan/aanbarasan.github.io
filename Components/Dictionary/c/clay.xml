      <WordDefinition>Clay
   This word is used of sediment found in pits or in streets (Isa.
   57:20; Jer. 38:60), of dust mixed with spittle (John 9:6), and
   of potter's clay (Isa. 41:25; Nah. 3:14; Jer. 18:1-6; Rom.
   9:21). Clay was used for sealing (Job 38:14; Jer. 32:14). Our
   Lord's tomb may have been thus sealed (Matt. 27:66). The
   practice of sealing doors with clay is still common in the East.
   Clay was also in primitive times used for mortar (Gen. 11:3).
   The "clay ground" in which the large vessels of the temple were
   cast (1 Kings 7:46; 2 Chr. 4:17) was a compact loam fitted for
   the purpose. The expression literally rendered is, "in the
   thickness of the ground,", meaning, "in stiff ground" or in
   clay.
