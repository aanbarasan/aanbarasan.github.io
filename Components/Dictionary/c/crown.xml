      <WordDefinition>Crown
   (1.) Denotes the plate of gold in the front of the high priest's
   mitre (Ex. 29:6; 39:30). The same Hebrew word so rendered
   (ne'zer) denotes the diadem worn by Saul in battle (2 Sam.
   1:10), and also that which was used at the coronation of Joash
   (2 Kings 11:12).
   
     (2.) The more general name in Hebrew for a crown is _'atarah_,
   meaning a "circlet." This is used of crowns and head ornaments
   of divers kinds, including royal crowns. Such was the crown
   taken from the king of Ammon by David (2 Sam. 12:30). The crown
   worn by the Assyrian kings was a high mitre, sometimes adorned
   with flowers. There are sculptures also representing the crowns
   worn by the early Egyptian and Persian kings. Sometimes a diadem
   surrounded the royal head-dress of two or three fillets. This
   probably signified that the wearer had dominion over two or
   three countries. In Rev. 12:3; 13:1, we read of "many crowns," a
   token of extended dominion.
   
     (3.) The ancient Persian crown (Esther 1:11; 2:17; 6:8) was
   called _kether_; i.e., "a chaplet," a high cap or tiara. Crowns
   were worn sometimes to represent honour and power (Ezek. 23:42).
   They were worn at marriages (Cant. 3:11; Isa. 61:10,
   "ornaments;" R.V., "a garland"), and at feasts and public
   festivals.
   
     The crown was among the Romans and Greeks a symbol of victory
   and reward. The crown or wreath worn by the victors in the
   Olympic games was made of leaves of the wild olive; in the
   Pythian games, of laurel; in the Nemean games, of parsley; and
   in the Isthmian games, of the pine. The Romans bestowed the
   "civic crown" on him who saved the life of a citizen. It was
   made of the leaves of the oak. In opposition to all these fading
   crowns the apostles speak of the incorruptible crown, the crown
   of life (James 1:12; Rev. 2:10) "that fadeth not away" (1 Pet.
   5:4, Gr. amarantinos; comp. 1:4). Probably the word "amaranth"
   was applied to flowers we call "everlasting," the "immortal
   amaranth."
