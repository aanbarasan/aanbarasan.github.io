      <WordDefinition>condom
     
        1. The protective plastic bag that accompanies 3.5-inch
        microfloppy diskettes.  Rarely, also used of (paper) disk
        envelopes.  Unlike the write protect tab, the condom (when
        left on) not only impedes the practice of {SEX} but has also
        been shown to have a high failure rate as drive mechanisms
        attempt to access the disk - and can even fatally frustrate
        insertion.
     
        2. The protective cladding on a {light pipe}.
     
        3. "keyboard condom": A flexible, transparent plastic cover
        for a keyboard, designed to provide some protection against
        dust and {programming fluid} without impeding typing.
     
        4. "elephant condom": the plastic shipping bags used inside
        cardboard boxes to protect hardware in transit.
