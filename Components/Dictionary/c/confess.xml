   Syn: Admit; grant; concede; avow; own; assent; recognize;
        prove; exhibit; attest.

   Usage: {To Confess}, {Acknowledge}, {Avow}. Acknowledge is
          opposed to conceal. We acknowledge what we feel must
          or ought to be made known. (See {Acknowledge}.) Avow
          is opposed to withhold. We avow when we make an open
          and public declaration, as against obloquy or
          opposition; as, to avow one's principles; to avow
          one's participation in some act. Confess is opposed to
          deny. We confess (in the ordinary sense of the word)
          what we feel to have been wrong; as, to confess one's
          errors or faults. We sometimes use confess and
          acknowledge when there is no admission of our being in
          the wrong; as, this, I confess, is my opinion; I
          acknowledge I have always thought so; but in these
          cases we mean simply to imply that others may perhaps
          think us in the wrong, and hence we use the words by
          way of deference to their opinions. It was in this way
          that the early Christians were led to use the Latin
          confiteor and confessio fidei to denote the public
          declaration of their faith in Christianity; and hence
          the corresponding use in English of the verb confess
          and the noun confession.
