      <WordDefinition>City \Cit"y\ (s[i^]t"[y^]), n.; pl. {Cities} (s[i^]t"[i^]z).
   [OE. cite, F. cit['e], fr. L. civitas citizenship, state,
   city, fr. civis citizen; akin to Goth. heiwa (in heiwafrauja
   man of the house), AS. h[imac]wan, pl., members of a family,
   servants, h[imac]red family, G. heirath marriage, prop.,
   providing a house, E. hind a peasant.]
   1. A large town.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. A corporate town; in the United States, a town or
      collective body of inhabitants, incorporated and governed
      by a mayor and aldermen or a city council consisting of a
      board of aldermen and a common council; in Great Britain,
      a town corporate, which is or has been the seat of a
      bishop, or the capital of his see.
      [1913 Webster]

            A city is a town incorporated; which is, or has
            been, the see of a bishop; and though the bishopric
            has been dissolved, as at Westminster, it yet
            remaineth a city.                     --Blackstone
      [1913 Webster]

            When Gorges constituted York a city, he of course
            meant it to be the seat of a bishop, for the word
            city has no other meaning in English law. --Palfrey
      [1913 Webster]

   3. The collective body of citizens, or inhabitants of a city.
      ``What is the city but the people?'' --Shak.

   Syn: See {Village}.
        [1913 Webster]
