      <WordDefinition>coupling
     
        &lt;programming, hardware&gt; The degree to which components depend
        on one another.  There are two types of coupling, "tight" and
        "loose".  Loose coupling is desirable for good {software
        engineering} but tight coupling may be necessary for maximum
        performance.  Coupling is increased when the data exchanged
        between components becomes larger or more complex.
