   Introduction Cuba
   -----------------
                            Background: Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to
                                        victory in 1959; his iron rule has
                                        held the country together since.
                                        Cuba's Communist revolution, with
                                        Soviet support, was exported
                                        throughout Latin America and Africa
                                        during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. The
                                        country is now slowly recovering
                                        from a severe economic recession in
                                        1990, following the withdrawal of
                                        former Soviet subsidies, worth $4
                                        billion to $6 billion annually.
                                        Havana portrays its difficulties as
                                        the result of the US embargo in
                                        place since 1961. Illicit migration
                                        to the US - using homemade rafts,
                                        alien smugglers, or falsified visas
                                        - is a continuing problem. Some
                                        3,000 Cubans attempted the crossing
                                        of the Straits of Florida in 2001;
                                        the US Coast Guard interdicted only
                                        about 25% of these.

                                        some 3,000 Cubans took to the
                                        Straits of Florida in 2001; the US
                                        Coast Guard interdicted about 25% of
                                        these migrants; Cubans also use non-
                                        maritime routes to enter the US;
                                        some 2,400 Cubans arrived overland
                                        via the southwest border and direct
                                        flights to Miami in 2000

   Economy Cuba
   ------------
                    Economy - overview: The government continues to balance
                                        the need for economic loosening
                                        against a concern for firm political
                                        control. It has undertaken limited
                                        reforms in recent years to stem
                                        excess liquidity, increase
                                        enterprise efficiency, and alleviate
                                        serious shortages of food, consumer
                                        goods, and services, but is unlikely
                                        to implement extensive changes. A
                                        major feature of the economy is the
                                        dichotomy between relatively
                                        efficient export enclaves and
                                        inefficient domestic sectors. The
                                        average Cuban's standard of living
                                        remains at a lower level than before
                                        the severe economic depression of
                                        the early 1990s, which was caused by
                                        the loss of Soviet aid and domestic
                                        inefficiencies. High oil prices,
                                        recessions in key export markets,
                                        and damage from Hurricane Michelle
                                        hampered growth in 2001. Cuba paid
                                        high prices for oil imports in the
                                        face of slumping prices in the key
                                        sugar and nickel industries and
                                        suffered a slowdown in tourist
                                        arrivals following September 11. The
                                        government subsequently depreciated
                                        the peso by approximately 30% and
