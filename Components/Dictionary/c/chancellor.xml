      <WordDefinition>Chancellor \Chan"cel*lor\, n. [OE. canceler, chaunceler, F.
   chancelier, LL. cancellarius chancellor, a director of
   chancery, fr. L. cancelli lattices, crossbars, which
   surrounded the seat of judgment. See {Chancel}.]
   A judicial court of chancery, which in England and in the
   United States is distinctively a court with equity
   jurisdiction.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The chancellor was originally a chief scribe or
         secretary under the Roman emperors, but afterward was
         invested with judicial powers, and had superintendence
         over the other officers of the empire. From the Roman
         empire this office passed to the church, and every
         bishop has his chancellor, the principal judge of his
         consistory. In later times, in most countries of
         Europe, the chancellor was a high officer of state,
         keeper of the great seal of the kingdom, and having the
         supervision of all charters, and like public
         instruments of the crown, which were authenticated in
         the most solemn manner. In France a secretary is in
         some cases called a chancellor. In Scotland, the
         appellation is given to the foreman of a jury, or
         assize. In the present German empire, the chancellor is
         the president of the federal council and the head of
         the imperial administration. In the United States, the
         title is given to certain judges of courts of chancery
         or equity, established by the statutes of separate
         States. --Blackstone. Wharton.
