        &lt;character&gt; "," {ASCII} character 44.  Common names: {ITU-T}:
        comma.  Rare: {ITU-T}: cedilla; {INTERCAL}: tail.
     
        In the {C} programming language, "," is an operator which
        evaluates its first argument (which presumably has
        {side-effect}s) and then returns the value of its second
        argument.  This is useful in "for" statements and {macro}s.
