      <WordDefinition>Cart
   a vehicle moving on wheels, and usually drawn by oxen (2 Sam.
   6:3). The Hebrew word thus rendered, _'agalah_ (1 Sam. 6:7, 8),
   is also rendered "wagon" (Gen. 45:19). It is used also to denote
   a war-chariot (Ps. 46:9). Carts were used for the removal of the
   ark and its sacred utensils (Num. 7:3, 6). After retaining the
   ark amongst them for seven months, the Philistines sent it back
   to the Israelites. On this occasion they set it in a new cart,
   probably a rude construction, with solid wooden wheels like that
   still used in Western Asia, which was drawn by two milch cows,
   which conveyed it straight to Beth-shemesh.
   
     A "cart rope," for the purpose of fastening loads on carts, is
   used (Isa. 5:18) as a symbol of the power of sinful pleasures or
   habits over him who indulges them. (See {CORD}.) In
   Syria and Palestine wheel-carriages for any other purpose than
   the conveyance of agricultural produce are almost unknown.
