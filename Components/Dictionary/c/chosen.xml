      <WordDefinition>Chosen
   spoken of warriors (Ex. 15:4; Judg. 20:16), of the Hebrew nation
   (Ps. 105:43; Deut. 7:7), of Jerusalem as the seat of the temple
   (1 Kings 11:13). Christ is the "chosen" of God (Isa. 42:1); and
   the apostles are "chosen" for their work (Acts 10:41). It is
   said with regard to those who do not profit by their
   opportunities that "many are called, but few are chosen" (Matt.
   20:16). (See {ELECTION}.)
