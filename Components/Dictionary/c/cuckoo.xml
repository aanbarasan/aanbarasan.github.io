      <WordDefinition>Cuckoo
   (Heb. shahaph), from a root meaning "to be lean; slender." This
   bird is mentioned only in Lev. 11:16 and Deut. 14:15 (R.V.,
   "seamew"). Some have interpreted the Hebrew word by "petrel" or
   "shearwater" (Puffinus cinereus), which is found on the coast of
   Syria; others think it denotes the "sea-gull" or "seamew." The
   common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) feeds on reptiles and large
   insects. It is found in Asia and Africa as well as in Europe. It
   only passes the winter in Palestine. The Arabs suppose it to
   utter the cry _Yakub_, and hence they call it _tir el-Yakub_;
   i.e., "Jacob's bird."

      <WordDefinition>Cuckoo \Cuck"oo\ (k[oo^]k"[=oo]), n. [OE. coccou, cukkow, F.
   coucou, prob. of imitative origin; cf. L. cuculus, Gr. ????,
   Skr. k?ki?a, G. kuckuk, D. koekoek.] (Zo["o]l.)
   A bird belonging to {Cuculus}, {Coccyzus}, and several allied
   genera, of many species.

   Note: The European cuckoo ({Cuculus canorus}) builds no nest
         of its own, but lays its eggs in the nests of other
         birds, to be hatched by them. The American
         yellow-billed cuckoo ({Coccyzus Americanus}) and the
         black-billed cuckoo ({Coccyzus erythrophthalmus}) build
         their own nests.
         [1913 Webster]
