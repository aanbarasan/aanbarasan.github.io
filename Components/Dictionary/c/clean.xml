      <WordDefinition>Clean
   The various forms of uncleanness according to the Mosaic law are
   enumerated in Lev. 11-15; Num. 19. The division of animals into
   clean and unclean was probably founded on the practice of
   sacrifice. It existed before the Flood (Gen. 7:2). The
   regulations regarding such animals are recorded in Lev. 11 and
   Deut. 14:1-21.
   
     The Hebrews were prohibited from using as food certain animal
   substances, such as (1) blood; (2) the fat covering the
   intestines, termed the caul; (3) the fat on the intestines,
   called the mesentery; (4) the fat of the kidneys; and (5) the
   fat tail of certain sheep (Ex. 29:13, 22; Lev. 3:4-9; 9:19;
   17:10; 19:26).
   
     The chief design of these regulations seems to have been to
   establish a system of regimen which would distinguish the Jews
   from all other nations. Regarding the design and the abolition
   of these regulations the reader will find all the details in
   Lev. 20:24-26; Acts 10:9-16; 11:1-10; Heb. 9:9-14.

      <WordDefinition>Clean
     
        &lt;language&gt; A {lazy} {higher-order} {purely functional
        language} from the {University of Nijmegen}.  Clean was
        originally a subset of {Lean}, designed to be an experimental
        {intermediate language} and used to study the {graph
        rewriting} model.  To help focus on the essential
        implementation issues it deliberately lacked all {syntactic
        sugar}, even {infix} expressions or {complex lists},
     
        As it was used more and more to construct all kinds of
        applications it was eventually turned into a general purpose
        functional programming language, first released in May 1995.
        The new language is {strongly typed} (Milner/Mycroft type
        system), provides {modules} and {functional I/O} (including a
        {WIMP} interface), and supports {parallel processing} and
        {distributed processing} on {loosely coupled} parallel
        architectures.  Parallel execution was originally based on the
        {PABC} {abstract machine}.
     
        It is one of the fastest implementations of functional
        languages available, partly aided by programmer {annotations}
        to influence evaluation order.
     
        Although the two variants of Clean are rather different, the
        name Clean can be used to denote either of them.  To
        distinguish, the old version can be referred to as Clean 0.8,
        and the new as Clean 1.0 or Concurrent Clean.
     
        The current release of Clean (1.0) includes a compiler,
        producing code for the {ABC} {abstract machine}, a {code
        generator}, compiling the ABC code into either {object-code}
        or {assembly language} (depending on the {platform}), I/O
        libraries, a {development environment} (not all platforms),
        and {documentation}.  It is supported (or will soon be
        supported) under {Mac OS}, {Linux}, {OS/2}, {Windows 95},
        {SunOS}, and {Solaris}.

        1. Used of hardware or software designs, implies "elegance in
        the small", that is, a design or implementation that may not
        hold any surprises but does things in a way that is reasonably
        intuitive and relatively easy to comprehend from the outside.
        The antonym is "grungy" or crufty.
     
        2. To remove unneeded or undesired files in a effort to reduce
        clutter: "I'm cleaning up my account."  "I cleaned up the
        garbage and now have 100 Meg free on that partition."
