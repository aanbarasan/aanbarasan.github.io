      <WordDefinition>Cake
   Cakes made of wheat or barley were offered in the temple. They
   were salted, but unleavened (Ex. 29:2; Lev. 2:4). In idolatrous
   worship thin cakes or wafers were offered "to the queen of
   heaven" (Jer. 7:18; 44:19).
   
     Pancakes are described in 2 Sam. 13:8, 9. Cakes mingled with
   oil and baked in the oven are mentioned in Lev. 2:4, and "wafers
   unleavened anointed with oil," in Ex. 29:2; Lev. 8:26; 1 Chr.
   23:29. "Cracknels," a kind of crisp cakes, were among the things
   Jeroboam directed his wife to take with her when she went to
   consult Ahijah the prophet at Shiloh (1 Kings 14:3). Such hard
   cakes were carried by the Gibeonites when they came to Joshua
   (9:5, 12). They described their bread as "mouldy;" but the
   Hebrew word _nikuddim_, here used, ought rather to be rendered
   "hard as biscuit." It is rendered "cracknels" in 1 Kings 14:3.
   The ordinary bread, when kept for a few days, became dry and
   excessively hard. The Gibeonites pointed to this hardness of
   their bread as an evidence that they had come a long journey.
   
     We read also of honey-cakes (Ex. 16:31), "cakes of figs" (1
   Sam. 25:18), "cake" as denoting a whole piece of bread (1 Kings
   17:12), and "a [round] cake of barley bread" (Judg. 7:13). In
   Lev. 2 is a list of the different kinds of bread and cakes which
   were fit for offerings.
