            to express it to the eye.             --Holder.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. Style of writing or printing; handwriting; the peculiar
      form of letters used by a particular person or people; as,
      an inscription in the Runic character.

      person or a thing is distinguished from others; the stamp

   10. One of the persons of a drama or novel.
       [1913 Webster]

   Note: ``It would be well if character and reputation were
         used distinctively. In truth, character is what a
         person is; reputation is what he is supposed to be.
         Character is in himself, reputation is in the minds of
         others. Character is injured by temptations, and by
         wrongdoing; reputation by slanders, and libels.
         Character endures throughout defamation in every form,
         but perishes when there is a voluntary transgression;
         reputation may last through numerous transgressions,
         but be destroyed by a single, and even an unfounded,
         accusation or aspersion.'' --Abbott.
