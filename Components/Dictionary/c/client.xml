        &lt;programming&gt; A computer system or process that requests a
        service of another computer system or process (a "{server}")
        using some kind of {protocol} and accepts the server's
        responses.  A client is part of a {client-server} software
        architecture.
     
        For example, a {workstation} requesting the contents of a file
        from a {file server} is a client of the file server.
