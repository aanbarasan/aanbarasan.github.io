        &lt;programming&gt; (Or "remark") Explanatory text embedded in
        program {source} (or less often data) intended to help human
        readers understand it.
     
        Code completely without comments is often hard to read, but
        too heavily commented code isn't much better, especially if
        the comments are not kept up-to-date with changes to the code.
        Too much commenting may mean that the code is
        over-complicated.  A good rule is to comment everything that
        needs it but write code that doesn't need much of it.
     
        A particularly irksome form of over-commenting explains
        exactly what each statement does, even when it is obvious to
        any reasonably competant programmer, e.g.
     
        	/* Open the input file */
        	infd = open(input_file, O_RDONLY);
