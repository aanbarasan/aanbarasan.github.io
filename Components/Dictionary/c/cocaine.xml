      <WordDefinition>Cocaine \Co"ca*ine\, n. (Chem.)
   A powerful narcotic alkaloid, {C17H21NO4}, obtained from the
   leaves of coca. It is a bitter, white, crystalline substance,
   and is remarkable for producing local insensibility to pain.
   It is classified as addictive and is not available in the U.
   S. without a prescription, but is nevertheless one of the
   most widespread illegal drugs of abuse. It is used in several
   forms, including small pellets of free base, called {crack}.
   Most of the cacaine illegally used in the U.S. is imported.
   [1913 Webster +PJC]
