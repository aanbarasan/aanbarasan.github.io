      <WordDefinition>Castanets \Cas"ta*nets\, n. pl. [F. castagnettes, Sp.
   casta[~n]etas, fr. L. castanea (Sp. casta[~n]a) a chestnut.
   So named from the resemblance to two chestnuts, or because
   chestnuts were first used for castanets. See {Chestnut}.]
   Two small, concave shells of ivory or hard wood, shaped like
   spoons, fastened to the thumb, and beaten together with the
   middle finger; -- used by the Spaniards and Moors as an
   accompaniment to their dance and guitars.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The singular, castanet, is used of one of the pair, or,
         sometimes, of the pair forming the instrument.
         [1913 Webster]

               The dancer, holding a castanet in each hand,
               rattles them to the motion of his feet. --Moore
                                                  (Encyc. of
                                                  Music).
