      <WordDefinition>Citizenship
   the rights and privileges of a citizen in distinction from a
   foreigner (Luke 15:15; 19:14; Acts 21:39). Under the Mosaic law
   non-Israelites, with the exception of the Moabites and the
   Ammonites and others mentioned in Deut. 23:1-3, were admitted to
   the general privileges of citizenship among the Jews (Ex. 12:19;
   Lev. 24:22; Num. 15:15; 35:15; Deut. 10:18; 14:29; 16:10, 14).
   
     The right of citizenship under the Roman government was
   granted by the emperor to individuals, and sometimes to
   provinces, as a favour or as a recompense for services rendered
   to the state, or for a sum of money (Acts 22:28). This "freedom"
   secured privileges equal to those enjoyed by natives of Rome.
   Among the most notable of these was the provision that a man
   could not be bound or imprisoned without a formal trial (Acts
   22:25, 26), or scourged (16:37). All Roman citizens had the
   right of appeal to Caesar (25:11).
