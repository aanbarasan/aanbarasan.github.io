   1. The weight by which precious stones and pearls are
      weighed.

   Note: The carat equals three and one fifth grains Troy, and
         is divided into four grains, sometimes called carat
         grains. Diamonds and other precious stones are
         estimated by carats and fractions of carats, and

   Note: A mass of metal is said to be so many carats fine,
         according to the number of twenty-fourths of pure gold
         which it contains; as, 22 carats fine (goldsmith's
         standard) = 22 parts of gold, 1 of copper, and 1 of
         silver.
