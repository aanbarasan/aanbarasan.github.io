      <WordDefinition>Crocodile \Croc"o*dile\ (kr[o^]k"[-o]*d[imac]l; 277), n. [L.
   crocodilus, Gr. kroko`deilos: cf. F. crocodile. Cf.
   {Cookatrice}.]
   1. (Zo["o]l.) A large reptile of the genus {Crocodilus}, of
      several species. They grow to the length of sixteen or
      eighteen feet, and inhabit the large rivers of Africa,
      Asia, and America. The eggs, laid in the sand, are hatched
      by the sun's heat. The best known species is that of the
      Nile ({Crocodilus vulgaris}, or {Crocodilus Niloticus}).
      The Florida crocodile ({Crocodilus Americanus}) is much
      less common than the alligator and has longer jaws. The
      name is also sometimes applied to the species of other
      related genera, as the gavial and the alligator.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. (Logic) A fallacious dilemma, mythically supposed to have
      been first used by a crocodile.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Crocodile bird} (Zo["o]l.), an African plover ({Pluvianus
      [ae]gypticus}) which alights upon the crocodile and
      devours its insect parasites, even entering its open mouth
      (according to reliable writers) in pursuit of files, etc.;
      -- called also {Nile bird}. It is the {trochilos} of
      ancient writers.

   {Crocodile tears}, false or affected tears; hypocritical
      sorrow; -- derived from the fiction of old travelers, that
      crocodiles shed tears over their prey.
