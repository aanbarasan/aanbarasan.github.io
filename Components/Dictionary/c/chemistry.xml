   {Natural day}, the space of twenty-four hours. --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Natural fats}, {Natural gas}, etc. See under {Fat}, {Gas}.
      etc.

   {Natural Harmony} (Mus.), the harmony of the triad or common
      chord.

   {Natural history}, in its broadest sense, a history or
      description of nature as a whole, including the sciences
      of {botany}, {zo["o]logy}, {geology}, {mineralogy},
      {paleontology}, {chemistry}, and {physics}. In recent
      usage the term is often restricted to the sciences of
      botany and zo["o]logy collectively, and sometimes to the
      science of zoology alone.

   {Natural law}, that instinctive sense of justice and of right
      and wrong, which is native in mankind, as distinguished
      from specifically revealed divine law, and formulated
      human law.

   {Natural modulation} (Mus.), transition from one key to its
      relative keys.

   {Natural order}. (Nat. Hist.) See under {order}.

   {Natural person}. (Law) See under {person}, n.

   {Natural philosophy}, originally, the study of nature in
      general; the natural sciences; in modern usage, that
      branch of physical science, commonly called {physics},
      which treats of the phenomena and laws of matter and
      considers those effects only which are unaccompanied by
      any change of a chemical nature; -- contrasted with
      {mental philosophy} and {moral philosophy}.

   {Natural scale} (Mus.), a scale which is written without
      flats or sharps.

   Note: Model would be a preferable term, as less likely to
         mislead, the so-called artificial scales (scales
         represented by the use of flats and sharps) being
         equally natural with the so-called natural scale.

   {Natural science}, the study of objects and phenomena
      existing in nature, especially biology, chemistry, physics
      and their interdisciplinary related sciences; {natural
      history}, in its broadest sense; -- used especially in
      contradistinction to {social science}, {mathematics},
      {philosophy}, {mental science} or {moral science}.

   {Natural selection} (Biol.), the operation of natural laws
      analogous, in their operation and results, to designed
      selection in breeding plants and animals, and resulting in
      the survival of the fittest; the elimination over time of
      species unable to compete in specific environments with
      other species more adapted to survival; -- the essential
      mechanism of evolution. The principle of natural selection
      is neutral with respect to the mechanism by which
      inheritable changes occur in organisms (most commonly
      thought to be due to mutation of genes and reorganization
      of genomes), but proposes that those forms which have
      become so modified as to be better adapted to the existing
      environment have tended to survive and leave similarly
      adapted descendants, while those less perfectly adapted
      have tended to die out through lack of fitness for the
      environment, thus resulting in the survival of the
      fittest. See {Darwinism}.

   {Natural system} (Bot. &amp; Zo["o]l.), a classification based
      upon real affinities, as shown in the structure of all
      parts of the organisms, and by their embryology.

            It should be borne in mind that the natural system
            of botany is natural only in the constitution of its
            genera, tribes, orders, etc., and in its grand
            divisions.                            --Gray.
      

   {Natural theology}, or {Natural religion}, that part of
      theological science which treats of those evidences of the
      existence and attributes of the Supreme Being which are
      exhibited in nature; -- distinguished from {revealed
      religion}. See Quotation under {Natural}, a., 3.

   {Natural vowel}, the vowel sound heard in urn, furl, sir,
      her, etc.; -- so called as being uttered in the easiest
      open position of the mouth organs. See {Neutral vowel},
      under {Neutral} and Guide to Pronunciation, [sect] 17.
      [1913 Webster +PJC]

   Syn: See {Native}.

      <WordDefinition>Chemistry \Chem"is*try\ (k[e^]m"[i^]s*tr[y^]; 277), n. [From
   {Chemist}. See {Alchemy}.]
   1. That branch of science which treats of the composition of
      substances, and of the changes which they undergo in
      consequence of alterations in the constitution of the
      molecules, which depend upon variations of the number,
      kind, or mode of arrangement, of the constituent atoms.
      These atoms are not assumed to be indivisible, but merely
      the finest grade of subdivision hitherto attained.
      Chemistry deals with the changes in the composition and
      constitution of molecules. See {Atom}, {Molecule}.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: Historically, chemistry is an outgrowth of alchemy (or
         alchemistry), with which it was anciently identified.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. An application of chemical theory and method to the
      consideration of some particular subject; as, the
      chemistry of iron; the chemistry of indigo.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. A treatise on chemistry.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: This word and its derivatives were formerly written
         with y, and sometimes with i, instead of e, in the
         first syllable, chymistry, chymist, chymical, etc., or
         chimistry, chimist, chimical, etc.; and the
         pronunciation was conformed to the orthography.
         [1913 Webster]

   {Inorganic chemistry}, that which treats of inorganic or
      mineral substances.

   {Organic chemistry}, that which treats of the substances
      which form the structure of organized beings and their
      products, whether animal or vegetable; -- called also
      {chemistry of the carbon compounds}. There is no
      fundamental difference between organic and inorganic
      chemistry.

   {Physiological chemistry}, the chemistry of the organs and
      tissues of the body, and of the various physiological
      processes incident to life.

   {Practical chemistry}, or {Applied chemistry}, that which
      treats of the modes of manufacturing the products of
      chemistry that are useful in the arts, of their
      applications to economical purposes, and of the conditions
      essential to their best use.

   {Pure chemistry}, the consideration of the facts and theories
      of chemistry in their purely scientific relations, without
      necessary reference to their practical applications or
      mere utility.
