      <WordDefinition>Cable \Ca"ble\ (k[=a]"b'l), n. [F. c[^a]ble, LL. capulum,
   caplum, a rope, fr. L. capere to take; cf. D., Dan., &amp; G.
   kabel, from the French. See {Capable}.]
   1. A large, strong rope or chain, of considerable length,
      used to retain a vessel at anchor, and for other purposes.
      It is made of hemp, of steel wire, or of iron links.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. A rope of steel wire, or copper wire, usually covered with
      some protecting or insulating substance; as, the cable of
      a suspension bridge; a telegraphic cable.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. (Arch) A molding, shaft of a column, or any other member
      of convex, rounded section, made to resemble the spiral
      twist of a rope; -- called also {cable molding}.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Bower cable}, the cable belonging to the bower anchor.

   {Cable road}, a railway on which the cars are moved by a
      continuously running endless rope operated by a stationary
      motor.

   {Cable's length}, the length of a ship's cable. Cables in the
      merchant service vary in length from 100 to 140 fathoms or
      more; but as a maritime measure, a cable's length is
      either 120 fathoms (720 feet), or about 100 fathoms (600
      feet, an approximation to one tenth of a nautical mile).
      

   {Cable tier}.
      (a) That part of a vessel where the cables are stowed.
      (b) A coil of a cable.

   {Sheet cable}, the cable belonging to the sheet anchor.

   {Stream cable}, a hawser or rope, smaller than the bower
      cables, to moor a ship in a place sheltered from wind and
      heavy seas.

   {Submarine cable}. See {Telegraph}.

   {To pay out the cable}, {To veer out the cable}, to slacken
      it, that it may run out of the ship; to let more cable run
      out of the hawse hole.

   {To serve the cable}, to bind it round with ropes, canvas,
      etc., to prevent its being, worn or galled in the hawse,
      et.

   {To slip the cable}, to let go the end on board and let it
      all run out and go overboard, as when there is not time to
      weigh anchor. Hence, in sailor's use, to die.
