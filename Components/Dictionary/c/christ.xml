      <WordDefinition>Christ
   anointed, the Greek translation of the Hebrew word rendered
   "Messiah" (q.v.), the official title of our Lord, occurring five
   hundred and fourteen times in the New Testament. It denotes that
   he was anointed or consecrated to his great redemptive work as
   Prophet, Priest, and King of his people. He is Jesus the Christ
   (Acts 17:3; 18:5; Matt. 22:42), the Anointed One. He is thus
   spoken of by Isaiah (61:1), and by Daniel (9:24-26), who styles
   him "Messiah the Prince."
   
     The Messiah is the same person as "the seed of the woman"
   (Gen. 3:15), "the seed of Abraham" (Gen. 22:18), the "Prophet
   like unto Moses" (Deut. 18:15), "the priest after the order of
   Melchizedek" (Ps. 110:4), "the rod out of the stem of Jesse"
   (Isa. 11:1, 10), the "Immanuel," the virgin's son (Isa. 7:14),
   "the branch of Jehovah" (Isa. 4:2), and "the messenger of the
   covenant" (Mal. 3:1). This is he "of whom Moses in the law and
   the prophets did write." The Old Testament Scripture is full of
   prophetic declarations regarding the Great Deliverer and the
   work he was to accomplish. Jesus the Christ is Jesus the Great
   Deliverer, the Anointed One, the Saviour of men. This name
   denotes that Jesus was divinely appointed, commissioned, and
   accredited as the Saviour of men (Heb. 5:4; Isa. 11:2-4; 49:6;
   John 5:37; Acts 2:22).
   
     To believe that "Jesus is the Christ" is to believe that he is
   the Anointed, the Messiah of the prophets, the Saviour sent of
   God, that he was, in a word, what he claimed to be. This is to
   believe the gospel, by the faith of which alone men can be
   brought unto God. That Jesus is the Christ is the testimony of
   God, and the faith of this constitutes a Christian (1 Cor. 12:3;
   1 John 5:1).
