      <WordDefinition>Cucumbers
   (Heb. plur. kishshuim; i.e., "hard," "difficult" of digestion,
   only in Num. 11:5). This vegetable is extensively cultivated in
   the East at the present day, as it appears to have been in
   earlier times among the Hebrews. It belongs to the gourd family
   of plants. In the East its cooling pulp and juice are most
   refreshing. "We need not altogether wonder that the Israelites,
   wearily marching through the arid solitudes of the Sinaitic
   peninsula, thought more of the cucumbers and watermelons of
   which they had had no lack in Egypt, rather than of the cruel
   bondage which was the price of these luxuries." Groser's
   Scripture Natural History.
   
     Isaiah speaks of a "lodge" (1:8; Heb. sukkah), i.e., a shed or
   edifice more solid than a booth, for the protection throughout
   the season from spring to autumn of the watchers in a "garden of
   cucumbers."
