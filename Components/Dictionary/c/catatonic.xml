      <WordDefinition>catatonic
     
        Describes a condition of suspended animation in which
        something is so {wedged} or {hung} that it makes no response.
        If you are typing on a {terminal} and suddenly the computer
        doesn't even echo the letters back to the screen as you type,
        let alone do what you're asking it to do, then the computer is
        suffering from catatonia (possibly because it has crashed).
        Compare {buzz}.
