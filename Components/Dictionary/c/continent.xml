   2. One of the grand divisions of land on the globe; the main

      its structure, which is that of a large basin bordered by
      mountain chains; as, the continent of North America.

   Note: The continents are now usually regarded as six in

         are also reffered to as continents; as, the Antarctic
         continent; the continent of Greenland. Europe, Asia,
         and Africa are often grouped together as the Eastern
         Continent, and North and South America as the Western
         Continent.
         [1913 Webster]

   {The Continent}, the main land of Europe, as distinguished
      from the islands, especially from England.
