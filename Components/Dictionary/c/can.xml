      <WordDefinition>Can \Can\, v. t. &amp; i.

   Note: [The transitive use is obsolete.] [imp. {Could}.] [OE.
         cunnen, cannen (1st sing. pres. I can), to know, know
         how, be able, AS. cunnan, 1st sing. pres. ic cann or
         can, pl. cunnon, 1st sing. imp. c[=u][eth]e (for
         cun[eth]e); p. p. c[=u][eth] (for cun[eth]); akin to
         OS. Kunnan, D. Kunnen, OHG. chunnan, G. k["o]nnen,
         Icel. kunna, Goth. Kunnan, and E. ken to know. The
         present tense I can (AS. ic cann) was originally a
         preterit, meaning I have known or Learned, and hence I
         know, know how. [root]45. See {Ken}, {Know}; cf. {Con},
         {Cunning}, {Uncouth}.]
   1. To know; to understand. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

            I can rimes of Rodin Hood.            --Piers
                                                  Plowman.
      [1913 Webster]

            I can no Latin, quod she.             --Piers
                                                  Plowman.
      [1913 Webster]

            Let the priest in surplice white,
            That defunctive music can.            --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. To be able to do; to have power or influence. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

            The will of Him who all things can.   --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

            For what, alas, can these my single arms? --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

            M[ae]c[ae]nas and Agrippa, who can most with
            C[ae]sar.                             --Beau. &amp; Fl.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. To be able; -- followed by an infinitive without to; as, I
      can go, but do not wish to.

   Syn: {Can but}, {Can not but}. It is an error to use the
        former of these phrases where the sens requires the
        latter. If we say, ``I can but perish if I go,'' ``But''
        means only, and denotes that this is all or the worst
        that can happen. When the apostle Peter said. ``We can
        not but speak of the things which we have seen and
        heard.'' he referred to a moral constraint or necessety
        which rested upon him and his associates; and the
        meaning was, We cannot help speaking, We cannot refrain
        from speaking. This idea of a moral necessity or
        constraint is of frequent occurrence, and is also
        expressed in the phrase, ``I can not help it.'' Thus we
        say. ``I can not but hope,'' ``I can not but believe,''
        ``I can not but think,'' ``I can not but remark,'' etc.,
        in cases in which it would be an error to use the phrase
        can but.
        [1913 Webster]

              Yet he could not but acknowledge to himself that
              there was something calculated to impress awe, . .
              . in the sudden appearances and vanishings . . .
              of the masque                       --De Quincey.
        [1913 Webster]

              Tom felt that this was a rebuff for him, and could
              not but understand it as a left-handed hit at his
              employer.                           --Dickens.

      <WordDefinition>can vt. To abort a job on a time-sharing system. Used esp. when the
   person doing the deed is an operator, as in "canned from the
   {{console}}". Frequently used in an imperative sense, as in "Can that
   print job, the LPT just popped a sprocket!" Synonymous with {gun}. It is
   said that the ASCII character with mnemonic CAN (0011000) was used as a
   kill-job character on some early OSes, but this is more likely to be
   short for `cancel'. Alternatively, this term may derive from mainstream
   slang `canned' for being laid off or fired.
