   Introduction Canada
   -------------------
                            Background: A land of vast distances and rich
                                        natural resources, Canada became a
                                        self-governing dominion in 1867
                                        while retaining ties to the British
                                        crown. Economically and
                                        technologically the nation has
                                        developed in parallel with the US,
                                        its neighbor to the south across an
                                        unfortified border. Its paramount
                                        political problem continues to be
                                        the relationship of the province of
                                        Quebec, with its French-speaking
                                        residents and unique culture, to the
                                        remainder of the country.

   Economy Canada
   --------------
                    Economy - overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial
                                        society, Canada today closely
                                        resembles the US in its market-
                                        oriented economic system, pattern of
                                        production, and high living
                                        standards. Since World War II, the
                                        impressive growth of the
                                        manufacturing, mining, and service
                                        sectors has transformed the nation
                                        from a largely rural economy into
                                        one primarily industrial and urban.
                                        The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade
                                        Agreement (FTA) and 1994 North
                                        American Free Trade Agreement
                                        (NAFTA) (which includes Mexico)
                                        touched off a dramatic increase in
                                        trade and economic integration with
                                        the US. As a result of the close
                                        cross-border relationship, the
                                        economic downturn in the United
                                        States in 2001 had a negative impact
                                        on the Canadian economy. Real growth
                                        averaged nearly 3% during 1993-2000,
                                        but declined in 2001. Unemployment
                                        is up, with contraction in the
                                        manufacturing and natural resource
                                        sectors. Nevertheless, with its
                                        great natural resources, skilled
                                        labor force, and modern capital
                                        plant Canada enjoys solid economic
                                        prospects. Two shadows loom, the
                                        first being the continuing
                                        constitutional impasse between
                                        English- and French-speaking areas,
                                        which has been raising the
                                        possibility of a split in the
