            The sounds water and fire, being once annexed to
            those two elements, it was certainly more natural to
            call beings participating of the first ``watery'',
            and the last ``fiery'', than to commute the terms,
            and call them by the reverse.         --J. Harris
      [1913 Webster]

            The utmost that could be obtained was that her
            sentence should be commuted from burning to
            beheading.                            --Macaulay.
