      <WordDefinition>coordinate
     
        &lt;mathematics&gt; One member of a {tuple} of numbers which defines
        the position of a point in some space.  Commonly used
        coordinate systems have as many coordinates as their are
        dimensions in the space, e.g. a pair for two dimensions.  The
        most common coordinate system is {Cartesian coordinates},
        probably followed by {polar coordinates}.

   2. pl. (Math.) Lines, or other elements of reference, by
      means of which the position of any point, as of a curve,
      is defined with respect to certain fixed lines, or planes,
      called co["o]rdinate axes and co["o]rdinate planes. See
      {Abscissa}.

   Note: Co["o]rdinates are of several kinds, consisting in some
         of the different cases, of the following elements,
         namely:
      (a) (Geom. of Two Dimensions) The abscissa and ordinate of
          any point, taken together; as the abscissa PY and
          ordinate PX of the point P (Fig. 2, referred to the
          co["o]rdinate axes AY and AX.
      (b) Any radius vector PA (Fig. 1), together with its angle
          of inclination to a fixed line, APX, by which any
          point A in the same plane is referred to that fixed
          line, and a fixed point in it, called the pole, P.
      (c) (Geom. of Three Dimensions) Any three lines, or
          distances, PB, PC, PD (Fig. 3), taken parallel to
          three co["o]rdinate axes, AX, AY, AZ, and measured
          from the corresponding co["o]rdinate fixed planes,
          YAZ, XAZ, XAY, to any point in space, P, whose
          position is thereby determined with respect to these
          planes and axes.
      (d) A radius vector, the angle which it makes with a fixed
          plane, and the angle which its projection on the plane
          makes with a fixed line line in the plane, by which
          means any point in space at the free extremity of the
          radius vector is referred to that fixed plane and
          fixed line, and a fixed point in that line, the pole
          of the radius vector.
          [1913 Webster]

   {Cartesian co["o]rdinates}. See under {Cartesian}.

   {Geographical co["o]rdinates}, the latitude and longitude of
      a place, by which its relative situation on the globe is
      known. The height of the above the sea level constitutes a
      third co["o]rdinate.

   {Polar co["o]rdinates}, co["o]rdinates made up of a radius
      vector and its angle of inclination to another line, or a
      line and plane; as those defined in
      (b) and
      (d) above.

   {Rectangular co["o]rdinates}, co["o]rdinates the axes of
      which intersect at right angles.

   {Rectilinear co["o]rdinates}, co["o]rdinates made up of right
      lines. Those defined in
      (a) and
      (c) above are called also {Cartesian co["o]rdinates}.

   {Trigonometrical co["o]rdinates} or {Spherical
   co["o]rdinates}, elements of reference, by means of which the
      position of a point on the surface of a sphere may be
      determined with respect to two great circles of the
      sphere.

   {Trilinear co["o]rdinates}, co["o]rdinates of a point in a
      plane, consisting of the three ratios which the three
      distances of the point from three fixed lines have one to
      another.
