      <WordDefinition>cracking n. [very common] The act of breaking into a computer system;
   what a {cracker} does. Contrary to widespread myth, this does not
   usually involve some mysterious leap of hackerly brilliance, but rather
   persistence and the dogged repetition of a handful of fairly well-known
   tricks that exploit common weaknesses in the security of target systems.
   Accordingly, most crackers are only mediocre hackers.
