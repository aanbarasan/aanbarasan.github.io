      <WordDefinition>centrifuge \centrifuge\ n.
   an apparatus having containers for liquids arrayed around a
   central pivot and rotated at a high speed, thus generating
   {centrifugal force} on the liquid, and separating substances
   (such as particles of solid or globules of an immiscible
   liquid) mixed together in suspension within the liquid.
   Suspensions which would settle only very slowly or not at all
   under gravity can be made to separate quickly in such a
   device.

   Note: The containers for holding the liquid in a centrifuge
         are held in a metal frame called the head or trunnion.
         The solid material collected at teh bottom of the
         liquid container is called the pellet. A centrifuge
         designed to run at very high speeds and thus generate
         very high centrifugal force is called an
         {ultracentrifuge}.

   Syn: extractor, separator.
