      <WordDefinition>cluster
     
        &lt;file system&gt; An elementary unit of allocation of a disk made
        up of one or more physical {blocks}.
     
        A {file} is made up of a whole number of possibly
        non-contiguous clusters.  The cluster size is a tradeoff
        between space efficiency (the bigger is the cluster, the
        bigger is on the average the wasted space at the end of each
        file) and the length of the {FAT}.
