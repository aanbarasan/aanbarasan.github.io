      <WordDefinition>Carnal
   Unconverted men are so called (1 Cor. 3:3). They are represented
   as of a "carnal mind, which is enmity against God" (Rom. 8:6,
   7). Enjoyments that minister to the wants and desires of man's
   animal nature are so called (Rom. 15:27; 1 Cor. 9:11). The
   ceremonial of the Mosaic law is spoken of as "carnal," because
   it related to things outward, the bodies of men and of animals,
   and the purification of the flesh (Heb. 7:16; 9:10). The weapons
   of Christian warfare are "not carnal", that is, they are not of
   man's device, nor are wielded by human power (2 Cor. 10:4).
