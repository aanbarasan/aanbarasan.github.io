      <WordDefinition>Collar
   (Heb. peh), means in Job 30:18 the mouth or opening of the
   garment that closes round the neck in the same way as a tunic
   (Ex. 39:23). The "collars" (Heb. netiphoth) among the spoils of
   the Midianites (Judg. 8:26; R.V., "pendants") were ear-drops.
   The same Hebrew word is rendered "chains" in Isa. 3:19.
