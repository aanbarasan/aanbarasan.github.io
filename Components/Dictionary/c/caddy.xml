      <WordDefinition>Caddy \Cad"dy\, n.; pl. {Caddies}. [Earlier spelt catty, fr.
   Malay kat[=i] a weight of 11/3 pounds. Cf. {Catty}.]
   1. A small box, can, or chest to keep tea in, also called
      {tea caddy}.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. a container to hold objects when not in use.

   3. (Computers) a container to hold a compact disk, used in
      some types of compact disk devices, which is inserted into
      the CD player during playing, or in the case of recordable
      CD-ROMS, during recording. It is approximately square and
      thin, slightly larger than the compact disk. However, many
      CD players have a drawer for the compact disk, requiring
      no caddy.
