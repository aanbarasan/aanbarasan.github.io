      <WordDefinition>Charmer
   one who practises serpent-charming (Ps. 58:5; Jer. 8:17; Eccl.
   10:11). It was an early and universal opinion that the most
   venomous reptiles could be made harmless by certain charms or by
   sweet sounds. It is well known that there are jugglers in India
   and in other Eastern lands who practise this art at the present
   day.
   
     In Isa. 19:3 the word "charmers" is the rendering of the
   Hebrew _'ittim_, meaning, properly, necromancers (R.V. marg.,
   "whisperers"). In Deut. 18:11 the word "charmer" means a dealer
   in spells, especially one who, by binding certain knots, was
   supposed thereby to bind a curse or a blessing on its object. In
   Isa. 3:3 the words "eloquent orator" should be, as in the
   Revised Version, "skilful enchanter."
