        [SF fandom] A science-fiction convention.  Not used of other
        sorts of conventions, such as professional meetings.  This
        term, unlike many others of SF-fan slang, is widely recognised
        even by hackers who aren't {fan}s. "We'd been corresponding on
        the net for months, then we met face-to-face at a con."
