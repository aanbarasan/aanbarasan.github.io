            Solon compared the people unto the sea, and orators

   3. (Gram.) To inflect according to the degrees of comparison;
      to state positive, comparative, and superlative forms of;
      as, most adjectives of one syllable are compared by
      affixing ``- er'' and ``-est'' to the positive form; as,
      black, blacker, blackest; those of more than one syllable
      are usually compared by prefixing ``more'' and ``most'',
      or ``less'' and ``least'', to the positive; as, beautiful,
      more beautiful, most beautiful.

   Syn: To {Compare}, {Compare with}, {Compare to}.

   Usage: Things are compared with each other in order to learn
          their relative value or excellence. Thus we compare
          Cicero with Demosthenes, for the sake of deciding
          which was the greater orator. One thing is compared to
          another because of a real or fanciful likeness or
          similarity which exists between them. Thus it has been
          common to compare the eloquence of Demosthenes to a
          thunderbolt, on account of its force, and the
          eloquence of Cicero to a conflagration, on account of
          its splendor. Burke compares the parks of London to
          the lungs of the human body.
          [1913 Webster]
