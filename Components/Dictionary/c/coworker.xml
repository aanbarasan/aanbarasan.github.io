      <WordDefinition>cow orker n. [Usenet] n. fortuitous typo for co-worker, widely used in
   Usenet, with perhaps a hint that orking cows is illegal. This term was
   popularized by Scott Adams (the creator of {Dilbert}) but already
   appears in the January 1996 version of the {scary devil monastery} FAQ.
   There are plausible reports that it was in use on talk.bizarre as early
   as 1992. Compare {hing}, {grilf}, {filk}, {newsfroup}.
