      <WordDefinition>Caviar \Cav"i*ar\, Caviare \Ca*viare"\, n. [F. caviar, fr. It.
   caviale, fr. Turk. Hav[=i][=a]r.]
   The roes of the sturgeon, prepared and salted; -- used as a
   relish, esp. in Russia.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: Caviare was considered a delicacy, by some, in
         Shakespeare's time, but was not relished by most. Hence
         Hamlet says of a certain play. ``'T was caviare to the
         general,'' i. e., above the taste of the common people.
