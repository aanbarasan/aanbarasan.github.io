   Syn: Anxiety; solicitude; concern; caution; regard;
        management; direction; oversight. -- {Care}, {Anxiety},
        {Solicitude}, {Concern}. These words express mental pain
        in different degress. Care belongs primarily to the
        intellect, and becomes painful from overburdened
        thought. Anxiety denotes a state of distressing
        uneasiness fron the dread of evil. Solicitude expresses
        the same feeling in a diminished degree. Concern is
        opposed to indifference, and implies exercise of anxious
        thought more or less intense. We are careful about the
        means, solicitous and anxious about the end; we are
        solicitous to obtain a good, anxious to avoid an evil.
