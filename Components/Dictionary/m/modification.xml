   cf. F. modification. See {Modify}.]
   1. The act of modifying, or the state of being modified; a
      change; as, the modification of an opinion, or of a
      machine. --Bentley.

   Syn: change, alteration, adjustment.
        [1913 Webster]

   2. Something which has been modified; a modified form or
      condition; state as modified; as, the various

   3. (Gram.) The alteration of the meaning of a word or phrase
      by another word or phrase; -- usually a restriction of the
      scope of the word modified; as, in the phrase ``a billion
      dollars is a relatively small sum to spend on cancer
      research'' the modification of small by relatively is
      needed to make the sentence accurate, rather than
      ludicrous.
