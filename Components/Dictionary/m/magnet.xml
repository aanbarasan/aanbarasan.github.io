      attracting iron and some of its ores, and, when freely
      suspended, of pointing to the poles; -- called also
      {natural magnet}.
      [1913 Webster]

            temple of Arsino["e] all of magnet, or this

         electrical current, is called an {electro-magnet}.
         [1913 Webster]
