      <WordDefinition>magnetic resonance imaging \mag*net"ic res"on*ance im"ag*ing\ n.
   (Medicine)
   a medical diagnostic procedure utilizing the phenomenon of
   {nuclear magnetic resonance} to generate images of internal
   parts of the body. It depends on the differential absorption
   of electromagnetic radiation by different types of living
   tissue in a magnetic field. It is complementary to X-ray
   imaging in that the softer tissue show more prominently in
   magnetic resonance images, rather than bone, as with X-rays.
   It is a non-invasive procedure, allowing such images to be
   obtained without penetration of the tissue by objects. It is
   abbreviated {MRI}. As with {computerized tomography}, the
   results are usually presented as images of sequential planar
   sections of that part of the body of concern to the
   physician.
