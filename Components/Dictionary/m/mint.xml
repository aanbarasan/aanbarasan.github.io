      <WordDefinition>Mint
   (Gr. heduosmon, i.e., "having a sweet smell"), one of the garden
   herbs of which the Pharisees paid tithes (Matt. 23:23; Luke
   11:42). It belongs to the labiate family of plants. The species
   most common in Syria is the Mentha sylvestris, the wild mint,
   which grows much larger than the garden mint (M. sativa). It was
   much used in domestic economy as a condiment, and also as a
   medicine. The paying of tithes of mint was in accordance with
   the Mosiac law (Deut. 14:22), but the error of the Pharisees lay
   in their being more careful about this little matter of the mint
   than about weightier matters.

      <WordDefinition>MiNT
     
        &lt;operating system&gt; (MinT is not TOS - a {recursive acronym}) A
        freeware, {open source operating system} for the {Atari ST}
        range of computers.  MiNT was originally based on a {port} of
        {BSD} to {Atari ST} computers by Eric R. Smith.  MiNT gave the
        Atari access to BSD's many network applications.  A short
        (1992-94) romance between MiNT and {Atari} Corp., who decided
        to convert the system to the {MultiTOS} {kernel}, produced a
        unique TOS/Unix hybrid, which provides simultaneous access to
        both {GEM} and BSD application libraries.
     
        Since MiNT is MultiTOS's kernel, it has kept all the features
        described above and, if an {AES} replacement is installed, it
        can show you a new face of MultiTOS.  Unlike MultiTOS however,
        MiNT is based on a different {file system}, that is faster and
        more flexible than TOS's.  Furthermore, thanks to the network
        support, MiNT allows an Atari to be an {Internet} {server}
        that can still run GEM and TOS applications!  This has won
        MiNT many devotees ("MiNTquisitors"), making it the main
        competitor for {ASH}'s {MagiC}.
     
        Unlike {Linux}, MiNT can run on a {Motorola 68000} with no
        {FPU}.  It needs at least 4 MB of RAM, more to run multiuser
        or to run GEM applications at the same time.
