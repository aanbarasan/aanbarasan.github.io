      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: {Memory}, {Remembrance}, {Recollection}, {Reminiscence}.

   Usage: Memory is the generic term, denoting the power by
          which we reproduce past impressions. Remembrance is an
          exercise of that power when things occur spontaneously
          to our thoughts. In recollection we make a distinct
          effort to collect again, or call back, what we know
          has been formerly in the mind. Reminiscence is
          intermediate between remembrance and recollection,
          being a conscious process of recalling past
          occurrences, but without that full and varied
          reference to particular things which characterizes
          recollection. ``When an idea again recurs without the
          operation of the like object on the external sensory,
          it is remembrance; if it be sought after by the mind,
          and with pain and endeavor found, and brought again
          into view, it is recollection.'' --Locke.
          [1913 Webster]

   {To draw to memory}, to put on record; to record. [Obs.]
      --Chaucer. Gower.
      [1913 Webster]
