      <WordDefinition>Manger
   (Luke 2:7, 12, 16), the name (Gr. phatne, rendered "stall" in
   Luke 13:15) given to the place where the infant Redeemer was
   laid. It seems to have been a stall or crib for feeding cattle.
   Stables and mangers in our modern sense were in ancient times
   unknown in the East. The word here properly denotes "the ledge
   or projection in the end of the room used as a stall on which
   the hay or other food of the animals of travellers was placed."
   (See {INN}.)
