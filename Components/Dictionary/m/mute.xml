      <WordDefinition>Mute \Mute\, a. [L. mutus; cf. Gr. my`ein to shut, Skr. m[=u]ta
   bound, m[=u]ka dumb: cf. OE. muet, fr. F. muet, a dim. of OF.
   mu, L. mutus.]
   1. Not speaking; uttering no sound; silent.
      [1913 Webster]

            All the heavenly choir stood mute,
            And silence was in heaven.            --Milton.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In law a prisoner is said to stand mute, when, upon
         being arranged, he makes no answer, or does not plead
         directly, or will not put himself on trial.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. Incapable of speaking; dumb. --Dryden.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. Not uttered; unpronounced; silent; also, produced by
      complete closure of the mouth organs which interrupt the
      passage of breath; -- said of certain letters. See 5th
      {Mute}, 2.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. Not giving a ringing sound when struck; -- said of a
      metal.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Mute swan} (Zo["o]l.), a European wild white swan ({Cygnus
      olor} syn. {Cygnus gibbus}), which produces no loud notes,
      in distinction from the {Trumpeter swan}.
      [1913 Webster]

   Syn: Silent; dumb; speechless.

   Usage: {Mute}, {Silent}, {Dumb}. One is silent who does not
          speak; one is dumb who can not, for want of the proper
          organs; as, a dumb beast, etc.; and hence,
          figuratively, we speak of a person as struck dumb with
          astonishment, etc. One is mute who is held back from
          speaking by some special cause; as, he was mute
          through fear; mute astonishment, etc. Such is the case
          with most of those who never speak from childhood;
          they are not ordinarily dumb, but mute because they
          are deaf, and therefore never learn to talk; and hence
          their more appropriate name is deaf-mutes.
          [1913 Webster]

                They spake not a word;
                But, like dumb statues, or breathing stones,
                Gazed each on other.              --Shak.
          [1913 Webster]

                All sat mute,
                Pondering the danger with deep thoughts.
                                                  --Milton.
