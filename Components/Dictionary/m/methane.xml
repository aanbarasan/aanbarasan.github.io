      <WordDefinition>Methane \Meth"ane\, n. [See {Methal}.] (Chem.)
   A light, colorless, gaseous, inflammable hydrocarbon, {CH4};
   marsh gas. It is the simplest of the aliphatic hydrocarbons.
   See {Marsh gas}, under {Gas}.
   [1913 Webster]

   {Methane series} (Chem.), a series of saturated hydrocarbons,
      of which methane is the first member and type, and
      (because of their general chemical inertness and
      indifference) called also the {paraffin (little affinity)
      series}. The lightest members are gases, as methane,
      ethane; intermediate members are liquids, as hexane,
      heptane, etc. (found in benzine, kerosene, etc.); while
      the highest members are white, waxy, or fatty solids, as
      paraffin proper.
