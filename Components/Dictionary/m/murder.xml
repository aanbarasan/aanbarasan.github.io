      <WordDefinition>Murder
   Wilful murder was distinguished from accidental homicide, and
   was invariably visited with capital punishment (Num. 35:16, 18,
   21, 31; Lev. 24:17). This law in its principle is founded on the
   fact of man's having been made in the likeness of God (Gen. 9:5,
   6; John 8:44; 1 John 3:12, 15). The Mosiac law prohibited any
   compensation for murder or the reprieve of the murderer (Ex.
   21:12, 14; Deut. 19:11, 13; 2 Sam. 17:25; 20:10). Two witnesses
   were required in any capital case (Num. 35:19-30; Deut.
   17:6-12). If the murderer could not be discovered, the city
   nearest the scene of the murder was required to make expiation
   for the crime committed (Deut. 21:1-9). These offences also were
   to be punished with death, (1) striking a parent; (2) cursing a
   parent; (3) kidnapping (Ex. 21:15-17; Deut. 27:16).
