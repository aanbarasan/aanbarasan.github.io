          lies directly in our way, and necessarily arrests our
          attention; what is evident is seen so clearly as to
          remove doubt; what is manifest is very distinctly
          evident.
          [1913 Webster]

                So clear, so shining, and so evident,
                That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.

                His voice, his figure, and his gesture knew.
