   Note: The cellular siliceous rock called buhrstone is usually
         employed for millstones; also, some kinds of lava, as
         that Niedermendig, or other firm rock with rough
         texture. The surface of a millstone has usually a
         series of radial grooves in which the powdered material
         collects.
