      <WordDefinition>Martian
     
        {Packet}s that turn up unexpectedly on the wrong {network}
        because of bogus {routing} entries.  Also a packet which has
        an altogether bogus (non-registered or ill-formed) {internet
        address}, such as the test loopback interface [127.0.0.1].
        Such a packet will come back labelled with a source address
        that is clearly not of this earth.  "The domain server is
        getting lots of packets from Mars.  Does that gateway have a
        martian filter?"

   Note: In science fiction, it has often been postulated that
         there are intelligent creatures living on Mars, but no
         strong evidence of any form of life on Mars has been
         observed up to the end of 1998.
