   Introduction Mexico
   -------------------
                            Background: The site of advanced Amerindian
                                        civilizations, Mexico came under
                                        Spanish rule for three centuries
                                        before achieving independence early
                                        in the 19th century. A devaluation
                                        of the peso in late 1994 threw
                                        Mexico into economic turmoil,
                                        triggering the worst recession in
                                        over half a century. The nation
                                        continues to make an impressive
                                        recovery. Ongoing economic and
                                        social concerns include low real
                                        wages, underemployment for a large
                                        segment of the population,
                                        inequitable income distribution, and
                                        few advancement opportunities for
                                        the largely Amerindian population in
                                        the impoverished southern states.
                                        Elections held in July 2000 marked
                                        the first time since the 1910
                                        Mexican Revolution that the
                                        opposition defeated the party in
                                        government, the Institutional
                                        Revolutionary Party (PRI). Vicente
                                        FOX of the National Action Party
                                        (PAN) was sworn in on 1 December
                                        2000 as the first chief executive
                                        elected in free and fair elections.

                    Economy - overview: Mexico has a free market economy
                                        with a mixture of modern and
                                        outmoded industry and agriculture,
                                        increasingly dominated by the
                                        private sector. Recent
                                        administrations have expanded
                                        competition in seaports, railroads,
                                        telecommunications, electricity,
                                        natural gas distribution, and
                                        airports. Income distribution
                                        remains highly unequal. Trade with
                                        the US and Canada has tripled since
                                        the implementation of NAFTA in 1994.
                                        Following 6.9% growth in 2000, real
                                        GDP fell 0.3% in 2001, with the US
                                        slowdown the principal cause.
                                        Positive developments in 2001
                                        included a drop in inflation to
                                        6.5%, a sharp fall in interest
                                        rates, and a strong peso that
                                        appreciated 5% against the dollar.
                                        Mexico City implemented free trade
                                        agreements with Guatemala, Honduras,
                                        El Salvador, and the European Free
                                        Trade Area in 2001, putting more
                                        than 90% of trade under free trade
                                        agreements. Foreign direct
                                        investment reached $25 billion in
                                        2001, of which $12.5 billion came
                                        from the purchase of Mexico's second
