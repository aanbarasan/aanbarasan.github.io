      <WordDefinition>MIGRAINES
     
        &lt;tool&gt; A {graphical user interface} for evaluating and
        interacting with the {Aspirin} {neural network} simulation.
     
        Utilities exist for moving quickly from an {Aspirin}
        description of a network directly to an executable program for
        simulating and evaluating that network.  MIGRAINES has been
        kept separate from Aspirin so that its limitations do not
        restrict the performance of Aspirin.  However, in practice,
        they are used together.  This combination allows for simple
        specification and creation of efficient neural network systems
        that can be graphically analysed and tested.
