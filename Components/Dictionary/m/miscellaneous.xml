Hackers are more likely to have cats than dogs (in fact, it is widely
grokked that cats have the hacker nature). Many drive incredibly decrepit
heaps and forget to wash them; richer ones drive spiffy Porsches and RX-7s
and then forget to have them washed. Almost all hackers have terribly bad
handwriting, and often fall into the habit of block-printing everything
like junior draftsmen.
