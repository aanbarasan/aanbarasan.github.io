   Heb. Madai, which is rendered in the Authorized Version (1)
   "Madai," Gen. 10:2; (2) "Medes," 2 Kings 17:6; 18:11; (3)
   "Media," Esther 1:3; 10:2; Isa. 21:2; Dan. 8:20; (4) "Mede,"
   only in Dan. 11:1.
   
     We first hear of this people in the Assyrian cuneiform
   records, under the name of Amada, about B.C. 840. They appear to
   have been a branch of the Aryans, who came from the east bank of
   the Indus, and were probably the predominant race for a while in
   the Mesopotamian valley. They consisted for three or four
   centuries of a number of tribes, each ruled by its own chief,
   who at length were brought under the Assyrian yoke (2 Kings
   17:6). From this subjection they achieved deliverance, and
   formed themselves into an empire under Cyaxares (B.C. 633). This
   monarch entered into an alliance with the king of Babylon, and
   invaded Assyria, capturing and destroying the city of Nineveh
   (B.C. 625), thus putting an end to the Assyrian monarchy (Nah.
   1:8; 2:5,6; 3:13, 14).
   
     Media now rose to a place of great power, vastly extending its
   boundaries. But it did not long exist as an independent kingdom.
   It rose with Cyaxares, its first king, and it passed away with
   him; for during the reign of his son and successor Astyages, the
   Persians waged war against the Medes and conquered them, the two
   nations being united under one monarch, Cyrus the Persian (B.C.
   558).
   
     The "cities of the Medes" are first mentioned in connection
   with the deportation of the Israelites on the destruction of
   Samaria (2 Kings 17:6; 18:11). Soon afterwards Isaiah (13:17;
   21:2) speaks of the part taken by the Medes in the destruction
   of Babylon (comp. Jer. 51:11, 28). Daniel gives an account of
   the reign of Darius the Mede, who was made viceroy by Cyrus
   (Dan. 6:1-28). The decree of Cyrus, Ezra informs us (6:2-5), was
   found in "the palace that is in the province of the Medes,"
   Achmetha or Ecbatana of the Greeks, which is the only Median
   city mentioned in Scripture.
