            If God should please to reveal unto us this great
            mystery of the Trinity, or some other mysteries in
            our holy religion, we should not be able to
            understand them, unless he would bestow on us some
            new faculties of the mind.            --Swift.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. A kind of secret religious celebration, to which none were
