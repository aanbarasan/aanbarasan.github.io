      <WordDefinition>Molecular \Mo*lec"u*lar\, a. [Cf. F. mol['e]culare. See
   {Molecule}.] (Phys. &amp; Chem.)
   Pertaining to, connected with, produced by, or consisting of,
   molecules; as, molecular forces; molecular groups of atoms,
   etc.
   [1913 Webster]

   {Molecular attraction} (Phys.), attraction acting between the
      molecules of bodies, and at insensible distances.

   {Molecular weight} (Chem.), the weight of a molecule of any
      gas or vapor as compared with the hydrogen atom having
      weight of 1 as a standard; the sum of the atomic weights
      of the constituents of a molecule; thus, the molecular
      weight of water ({H2O}) is 18. For more precise
      measurements, the weight of the carbon isotope carbon-12
      is used as the standard, that isotope having the value of
      12.000. In this systen, now used almost universally, the
      hydrogen atom has a weight of 1.0079.
      [1913 Webster +PJC]
