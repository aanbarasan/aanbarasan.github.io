      <WordDefinition>Mistletoe \Mis"tle*toe\, n. [AS. mistelt[=a]n; mistel mistletoe
   + t[=a]n twig. AS. mistel is akin of D., G., Dan. &amp; Sw.
   mistel, OHG. mistil, Icel. mistilteinn; and AS. t[=a]n to D.
   teen, OHG. zein, Icel. teinn, Goth. tains. Cf. {Missel}.]
   (Bot.)
   A parasitic evergreen plant of Europe ({Viscum album}),
   bearing a glutinous fruit. When found upon the oak, where it
   is rare, it was an object of superstitious regard among the
   Druids. A bird lime is prepared from its fruit. [Written also
   {misletoe}, {misseltoe}, and {mistleto}.] --Lindley.
   --Loudon.
   [1913 Webster]

   Note: The mistletoe of the United States is {Phoradendron
         serotinum} (syn. {Phoradendron flavescens}), having
         broader leaves than the European kind. In different
         regions various similar plants are called by this name.
         The mistletoe is used as a decoration at Christmas
         time, and it is a tradition that two persons of the
         oposite sex finding each other under a mistletoe sprig
         should kiss.
         [1913 Webster +PJC]
