      <WordDefinition>Mole
   Heb. tinshameth (Lev. 11:30), probably signifies some species of
   lizard (rendered in R.V., "chameleon"). In Lev. 11:18, Deut.
   14:16, it is rendered, in Authorized Version, "swan" (R.V.,
   "horned owl").
   
     The Heb. holed (Lev. 11:29), rendered "weasel," was probably
   the mole-rat. The true mole (Talpa Europoea) is not found in
   Palestine. The mole-rat (Spalax typhlus) "is twice the size of
   our mole, with no external eyes, and with only faint traces
   within of the rudimentary organ; no apparent ears, but, like the
   mole, with great internal organs of hearing; a strong, bare
   snout, and with large gnawing teeth; its colour a pale slate;
   its feet short, and provided with strong nails; its tail only
   rudimentary."
   
     In Isa. 2:20, this word is the rendering of two words _haphar
   peroth_, which are rendered by Gesenius "into the digging of
   rats", i.e., rats' holes. But these two Hebrew words ought
   probably to be combined into one (lahporperoth) and translated
   "to the moles", i.e., the rat-moles. This animal "lives in
   underground communities, making large subterranean chambers for
   its young and for storehouses, with many runs connected with
   them, and is decidedly partial to the loose debris among ruins
   and stone-heaps, where it can form its chambers with least
   trouble."
