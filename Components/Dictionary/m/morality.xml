      <WordDefinition>Morality \Mo*ral"i*ty\, n.; pl. {Moralities}. [L. moralitas: cf.
   F. moralit['e].]
   1. The relation of conformity or nonconformity to the moral
      standard or rule; quality of an intention, a character, an
      action, a principle, or a sentiment, when tried by the
      standard of right.
      [1913 Webster]

            The morality of an action is founded in the freedom
            of that principle, by virtue of which it is in the
            agent's power, having all things ready and requisite
            to the performance of an action, either to perform
            or not perform it.                    --South.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. The quality of an action which renders it good; the
      conformity of an act to the accepted standard of right.
      [1913 Webster]

            Of moralitee he was the flower.       --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]

            I am bold to think that morality is capable of
            demonstration.                        --Locke.
      [1913 Webster]

   3. The doctrines or rules of moral duties, or the duties of
      men in their social character; ethics.
      [1913 Webster]

            The end of morality is to procure the affections to
            obey reason, and not to invade it.    --Bacon.
      [1913 Webster]

            The system of morality to be gathered out of . . .
            ancient sages falls very short of that delivered in
            the gospel.                           --Swift.
      [1913 Webster]

   4. The practice of the moral duties; rectitude of life;
      conformity to the standard of right; virtue; as, we often
      admire the politeness of men whose morality we question.
      [1913 Webster]

   5. A kind of allegorical play, so termed because it consisted
      of discourses in praise of morality between actors
      representing such characters as Charity, Faith, Death,
      Vice, etc. Such plays were occasionally exhibited as late
      as the reign of Henry VIII. --Strutt.
      [1913 Webster]

   6. Intent; meaning; moral. [Obs.]
      [1913 Webster]

            Taketh the morality thereof, good men. --Chaucer.
      [1913 Webster]
