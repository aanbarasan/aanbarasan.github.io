      <WordDefinition>malaria \ma*la"ri*a\, n. [It., contr. fr. malaaria bad air. See
   {Malice}, and Air.]
   1. Air infected with some noxious substance capable of
      engendering disease; esp., an unhealthy exhalation from
      certain soils, as marshy or wet lands, producing fevers;
      miasma. [Archaic]
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The morbific agent in malaria is supposed by some to be
         a vegetable microbe or its spores, and by others to be
         a very minute animal blood parasite (an infusorian).
         [1913 Webster]

   2. (Med.) A human disease caused by infection of red blood
      cells by a protozoan of the genus {Plasmodium}, giving
      rise to fever and chills and many other symptoms,
      characterized by their tendency to recur at definite and
      usually uniform intervals. The protozoal infection is
      usually transmitted from another infected individual by
      the bite of an {Anopheles} mosquito.
      [1913 Webster +PJC]
