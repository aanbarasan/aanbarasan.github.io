      <WordDefinition>M \M\ ([e^]m).
   1. M, the thirteenth letter of the English alphabet, is a
      vocal consonant, and from the manner of its formation, is
      called the labio-nasal consonant. See Guide to
      Pronunciation, [sect][sect] 178-180, 242.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: The letter M came into English from the Greek, through
         the Latin, the form of the Greek letter being further
         derived from the Ph[oe]nician, and ultimately, it is
         believed, from the Egyptian. Etymologically M is
         related to n, in lime, linden; emmet, ant; also to b.
         [1913 Webster] M is readily followed by b and p. the
         position of the lips in the formation of both letters
         being the same. The relation of b and m is the same as
         that of d and t to n. and that of g and k to ng.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. As a numeral, M stands for one thousand, both in English
      and Latin.
