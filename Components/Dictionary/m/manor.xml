      <WordDefinition>Manor \Man"or\, n. [OE. maner, OF. maneir habitation, village,
   F. manoir manor, prop. the OF. inf. maneir to stay, remain,
   dwell, L. manere, and so called because it was the permanent

      much land as a lord or great personage kept in his own

            My manors, rents, revenues, l forego. --Shak.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: In these days, a manor rather signifies the
         jurisdiction and royalty incorporeal, than the land or
         site, for a man may have a manor in gross, as the law
         terms it, that is, the right and interest of a
         court-baron, with the perquisites thereto belonging.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. (American Law) A tract of land occupied by tenants who pay
      a free-farm rent to the proprietor, sometimes in kind, and
      sometimes by performing certain stipulated services.
      --Burrill.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Manor house}, or {Manor seat}, the house belonging to a
      manor; the house of the lord of the manor; a manse.
      [1913 Webster]
