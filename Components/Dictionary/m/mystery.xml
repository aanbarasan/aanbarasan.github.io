      <WordDefinition>Mystery
   the calling of the Gentiles into the Christian Church, so
   designated (Eph. 1:9, 10; 3:8-11; Col. 1:25-27); a truth
   undiscoverable except by revelation, long hid, now made
   manifest. The resurrection of the dead (1 Cor. 15:51), and other
   doctrines which need to be explained but which cannot be fully
   understood by finite intelligence (Matt. 13:11; Rom. 11:25; 1
   Cor. 13:2); the union between Christ and his people symbolized
   by the marriage union (Eph. 5:31, 32; comp. 6:19); the seven
   stars and the seven candlesticks (Rev. 1:20); and the woman
   clothed in scarlet (17:7), are also in this sense mysteries. The
   anti-Christian power working in his day is called by the apostle
   (2 Thess. 2:7) the "mystery of iniquity."

            If God should please to reveal unto us this great
            mystery of the Trinity, or some other mysteries in

            understand them, unless he would bestow on us some
