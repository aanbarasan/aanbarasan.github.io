      <WordDefinition>management
     
        1. Corporate power elites distinguished primarily by their
        distance from actual productive work and their chronic failure
        to manage (see also {suit}).  Spoken derisively, as in
        "*Management* decided that ...".
     
        2. Mythically, a vast bureaucracy responsible for all the
        world's minor irritations.  Hackers' satirical public notices
        are often signed "The Mgt"; this derives from the
        "Illuminatus!" novels.
