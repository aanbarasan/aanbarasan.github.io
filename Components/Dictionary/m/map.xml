        1. &lt;mathematics&gt; {function}.
     
        2. &lt;programming&gt; In {functional programming}, the most common
        {higher-order function} over lists.  Map applies its first
        argument to each element of its second argument (a list) and
        returns the list of results.
     
        	map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
        	map f []     = []
        	map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
     
        This can be generalised to types other than lists.
