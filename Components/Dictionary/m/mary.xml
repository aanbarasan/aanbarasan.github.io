      <WordDefinition>Mary
   Hebrew Miriam. (1.) The wife of Joseph, the mother of Jesus,
   called the "Virgin Mary," though never so designated in
   Scripture (Matt. 2:11; Acts 1:14). Little is known of her
   personal history. Her genealogy is given in Luke 3. She was of
   the tribe of Judah and the lineage of David (Ps. 132:11; Luke
   1:32). She was connected by marriage with Elisabeth, who was of
   the lineage of Aaron (Luke 1:36).
   
     While she resided at Nazareth with her parents, before she
   became the wife of Joseph, the angel Gabriel announced to her
   that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah (Luke
   1:35). After this she went to visit her cousin Elisabeth, who
   was living with her husband Zacharias (probably at Juttah, Josh.
   15:55; 21:16, in the neighbourhood of Maon), at a considerable
   distance, about 100 miles, from Nazareth. Immediately on
   entering the house she was saluted by Elisabeth as the mother of
   her Lord, and then forthwith gave utterance to her hymn of
   thanksgiving (Luke 1:46-56; comp. 1 Sam. 2:1-10). After three
   months Mary returned to Nazareth to her own home. Joseph was
   supernaturally made aware (Matt. 1:18-25) of her condition, and
   took her to his own home. Soon after this the decree of Augustus
   (Luke 2:1) required that they should proceed to Bethlehem (Micah
   5:2), some 80 or 90 miles from Nazareth; and while they were
   there they found shelter in the inn or khan provided for
   strangers (Luke 2:6, 7). But as the inn was crowded, Mary had to
   retire to a place among the cattle, and there she brought forth
   her son, who was called Jesus (Matt. 1:21), because he was to
   save his people from their sins. This was followed by the
   presentation in the temple, the flight into Egypt, and their
   return in the following year and residence at Nazareth (Matt.
   2). There for thirty years Mary, the wife of Joseph the
   carpenter, resides, filling her own humble sphere, and pondering
   over the strange things that had happened to her. During these
   years only one event in the history of Jesus is recorded, viz.,
   his going up to Jerusalem when twelve years of age, and his
   being found among the doctors in the temple (Luke 2:41-52).
   Probably also during this period Joseph died, for he is not
   again mentioned.
   
     After the commencement of our Lord's public ministry little
   notice is taken of Mary. She was present at the marriage in
   Cana. A year and a half after this we find her at Capernaum
   (Matt. 12:46, 48, 49), where Christ uttered the memorable words,
   "Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched
   forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother
   and my brethren!" The next time we find her is at the cross
   along with her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome, and
   other women (John 19:26). From that hour John took her to his
   own abode. She was with the little company in the upper room
   after the Ascension (Acts 1:14). From this time she wholly
   disappears from public notice. The time and manner of her death
   are unknown.
   
     (2.) Mary Magdalene, i.e., Mary of Magdala, a town on the
   western shore of the Lake of Tiberias. She is for the first time
   noticed in Luke 8:3 as one of the women who "ministered to
   Christ of their substance." Their motive was that of gratitude
   for deliverances he had wrought for them. Out of Mary were cast
   seven demons. Gratitude to her great Deliverer prompted her to
   become his follower. These women accompanied him also on his
   last journey to Jerusalem (Matt. 27:55; Mark 15:41; Luke 23:55).
   They stood near the cross. There Mary remained till all was
   over, and the body was taken down and laid in Joseph's tomb.
   Again, in the earliest dawn of the first day of the week she,
   with Salome and Mary the mother of James (Matt. 28:1; Mark
   16:2), came to the sepulchre, bringing with them sweet spices,
   that they might anoint the body of Jesus. They found the
   sepulchre empty, but saw the "vision of angels" (Matt. 28:5).
   She hastens to tell Peter and John, who were probably living
   together at this time (John 20:1, 2), and again immediately
   returns to the sepulchre. There she lingers thoughtfully,
   weeping at the door of the tomb. The risen Lord appears to her,
   but at first she knows him not. His utterance of her name "Mary"
   recalls her to consciousness, and she utters the joyful,
   reverent cry, "Rabboni." She would fain cling to him, but he
   forbids her, saying, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to
   my Father." This is the last record regarding Mary of Magdala,
   who now returned to Jerusalem. The idea that this Mary was "the
   woman who was a sinner," or that she was unchaste, is altogether
   groundless.
   
     (3.) Mary the sister of Lazarus is brought to our notice in
   connection with the visits of our Lord to Bethany. She is
   contrasted with her sister Martha, who was "cumbered about many
   things" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen "the
   good part." Her character also appears in connection with the
   death of her brother (John 11:20,31,33). On the occasion of our
   Lord's last visit to Bethany, Mary brought "a pound of ointment
   of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus" as he
   reclined at table in the house of one Simon, who had been a
   leper (Matt. 26:6; Mark 14:3; John 12:2,3). This was an evidence
   of her overflowing love to the Lord. Nothing is known of her
   subsequent history. It would appear from this act of Mary's, and
   from the circumstance that they possessed a family vault
   (11:38), and that a large number of Jews from Jerusalem came to
   condole with them on the death of Lazarus (11:19), that this
   family at Bethany belonged to the wealthier class of the people.
   (See {MARTHA}.)
   
     (4.) Mary the wife of Cleopas is mentioned (John 19:25) as
   standing at the cross in company with Mary of Magdala and Mary
   the mother of Jesus. By comparing Matt. 27:56 and Mark 15:40, we
   find that this Mary and "Mary the mother of James the little"
   are on and the same person, and that she was the sister of our
   Lord's mother. She was that "other Mary" who was present with
   Mary of Magdala at the burial of our Lord (Matt. 27:61; Mark
   15:47); and she was one of those who went early in the morning
   of the first day of the week to anoint the body, and thus became
   one of the first witnesses of the resurrection (Matt. 28:1; Mark
   16:1; Luke 24:1).
   
     (5.) Mary the mother of John Mark was one of the earliest of
   our Lord's disciples. She was the sister of Barnabas (Col.
   4:10), and joined with him in disposing of their land and giving
   the proceeds of the sale into the treasury of the Church (Acts
   4:37; 12:12). Her house in Jerusalem was the common
   meeting-place for the disciples there.
   
     (6.) A Christian at Rome who treated Paul with special
   kindness (Rom. 16:6).
