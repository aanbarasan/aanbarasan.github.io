      physical or moral necessity; as, a man must eat for
      nourishment; we must submit to the laws.
      [1913 Webster]

   2. To be morally required; to be necessary or essential to a
      certain quality, character, end, or result; as, he must
      reconsider the matter; he must have been insane.
      [1913 Webster]

            Likewise must the deacons be grave.   --1 Tim. iii.
