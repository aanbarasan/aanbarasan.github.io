      <WordDefinition>MEDAL, n.  A small metal disk given as a reward for virtues,
attainments or services more or less authentic.
    It is related of Bismark, who had been awarded a medal for
gallantly rescuing a drowning person, that, being asked the meaning of
the medal, he replied:  "I save lives sometimes."  And sometimes he
didn't.
