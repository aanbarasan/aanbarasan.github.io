        /me"goh/ or /mee'goh/ ["My Eyes Glaze Over", often "Mine Eyes
        Glazeth (sic) Over", attributed to the futurologist Herman
        Kahn] Also "MEGO factor".  1.  A {handwave} intended to
        confuse the listener and hopefully induce agreement because
        the listener does not want to admit to not understanding what
        is going on.  MEGO is usually directed at senior management by
        engineers and contains a high proportion of {TLA}s.
        2. excl. An appropriate response to MEGO tactics.  3. Among
        non-hackers, often refers not to behaviour that causes the
        eyes to glaze, but to the eye-glazing reaction itself, which
        may be triggered by the mere threat of technical detail as
        effectively as by an actual excess of it.
