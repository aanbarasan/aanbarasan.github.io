      <WordDefinition>Mantle
   (1.) Heb. 'addereth, a large over-garment. This word is used of
   Elijah's mantle (1 Kings 19:13, 19; 2 Kings 2:8, 13, etc.),
   which was probably a sheepskin. It appears to have been his only
   garment, a strip of skin or leather binding it to his loins.
   _'Addereth_ twice occurs with the epithet "hairy" (Gen. 25:25;
   Zech. 13:4, R.V.). It is the word denoting the "goodly
   Babylonish garment" which Achan coveted (Josh. 7:21).
   
     (2.) Heb. me'il, frequently applied to the "robe of the ephod"
   (Ex. 28:4, 31; Lev. 8:7), which was a splendid under tunic
   wholly of blue, reaching to below the knees. It was woven
   without seam, and was put on by being drawn over the head. It
   was worn not only by priests but by kings (1 Sam. 24:4),
   prophets (15:27), and rich men (Job 1:20; 2:12). This was the
   "little coat" which Samuel's mother brought to him from year to
   year to Shiloh (1 Sam. 2:19), a miniature of the official
   priestly robe.
   
     (3.) Semikah, "a rug," the garment which Jael threw as a
   covering over Sisera (Judg. 4:18). The Hebrew word occurs
   nowhere else in Scripture.
   
     (4.) Maataphoth, plural, only in Isa. 3:22, denoting a large
   exterior tunic worn by females. (See {DRESS}.)
