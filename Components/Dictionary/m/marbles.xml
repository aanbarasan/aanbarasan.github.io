        &lt;jargon&gt; (From the mainstream "lost his marbles") The minimum
        needed to build your way further up some hierarchy of tools or
        abstractions.  After a bad system {crash}, you need to
        determine if the machine has enough marbles to come up on its
        own, or enough marbles to allow a rebuild from {backups}, or
        if you need to rebuild from scratch.  "This {compiler} doesn't
        even have enough marbles to compile {hello, world}."
