   Note: Motion, in mechanics, may be simple or compound.

   {Simple motions} are: ({a}) straight translation, which, if
      of indefinite duration, must be reciprocating. ({b})
      Simple rotation, which may be either continuous or
      reciprocating, and when reciprocating is called
      oscillating. ({c}) Helical, which, if of indefinite
      duration, must be reciprocating.

   {Compound motion} consists of combinations of any of the
      simple motions.
      [1913 Webster]

   {Center of motion}, {Harmonic motion}, etc. See under
      {Center}, {Harmonic}, etc.

   {Motion block} (Steam Engine), a crosshead.

   {Perpetual motion} (Mech.), an incessant motion conceived to
      be attainable by a machine supplying its own motive forces
      independently of any action from without. According to the
      law of conservation of energy, such perpetual motion is
      impossible, and no device has yet been built that is
      capable of perpetual motion.
      [1913 Webster +PJC]

   Syn: See {Movement}.
