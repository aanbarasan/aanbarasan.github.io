      <WordDefinition>MAN, n.  An animal so lost in rapturous contemplation of what he
thinks he is as to overlook what he indubitably ought to be.  His
chief occupation is extermination of other animals and his own
species, which, however, multiplies with such insistent rapidity as to
infest the whole habitable earh and Canada.

    When the world was young and Man was new,
        And everything was pleasant,
    Distinctions Nature never drew
        'Mongst kings and priest and peasant.
        We're not that way at present,
    Save here in this Republic, where
        We have that old regime,
    For all are kings, however bare
        Their backs, howe'er extreme
    Their hunger.  And, indeed, each has a voice
    To accept the tyrant of his party's choice.

    A citizen who would not vote,
        And, therefore, was detested,
    Was one day with a tarry coat
        (With feathers backed and breasted)
        By patriots invested.
    "It is your duty," cried the crowd,
        "Your ballot true to cast
    For the man o' your choice."  He humbly bowed,
        And explained his wicked past:
    "That's what I very gladly would have done,
    Dear patriots, but he has never run."
                                                         Apperton Duke

      <WordDefinition>Man
   (1.) Heb. 'Adam, used as the proper name of the first man. The
   name is derived from a word meaning "to be red," and thus the
   first man was called Adam because he was formed from the red
   earth. It is also the generic name of the human race (Gen. 1:26,
   27; 5:2; 8:21; Deut. 8:3). Its equivalents are the Latin homo
   and the Greek anthropos (Matt. 5:13, 16). It denotes also man in
   opposition to woman (Gen. 3:12; Matt. 19:10).
   
     (2.) Heb. 'ish, like the Latin vir and Greek aner, denotes
   properly a man in opposition to a woman (1 Sam. 17:33; Matt.
   14:21); a husband (Gen. 3:16; Hos. 2:16); man with reference to
   excellent mental qualities.
   
     (3.) Heb. 'enosh, man as mortal, transient, perishable (2 Chr.
   14:11; Isa. 8:1; Job 15:14; Ps. 8:4; 9:19, 20; 103:15). It is
   applied to women (Josh. 8:25).
   
     (4.) Heb. geber, man with reference to his strength, as
   distinguished from women (Deut. 22:5) and from children (Ex.
   12:37); a husband (Prov. 6:34).
   
     (5.) Heb. methim, men as mortal (Isa. 41:14), and as opposed
   to women and children (Deut. 3:6; Job 11:3; Isa. 3:25).
   
     Man was created by the immediate hand of God, and is
   generically different from all other creatures (Gen. 1:26, 27;
   2:7). His complex nature is composed of two elements, two
   distinct substances, viz., body and soul (Gen. 2:7; Eccl. 12:7;
   2 Cor. 5:1-8).
   
     The words translated "spirit" and "soul," in 1 Thess. 5:23,
   Heb. 4:12, are habitually used interchangeably (Matt. 10:28;
   16:26; 1 Pet. 1:22). The "spirit" (Gr. pneuma) is the soul as
   rational; the "soul" (Gr. psuche) is the same, considered as the
   animating and vital principle of the body.
   
     Man was created in the likeness of God as to the perfection of
   his nature, in knowledge (Col. 3:10), righteousness, and
   holiness (Eph. 4:24), and as having dominion over all the
   inferior creatures (Gen. 1:28). He had in his original state
   God's law written on his heart, and had power to obey it, and
   yet was capable of disobeying, being left to the freedom of his
   own will. He was created with holy dispositions, prompting him
   to holy actions; but he was fallible, and did fall from his
   integrity (3:1-6). (See {FALL}.)

         apple man, cloth man, coal man, hardware man, wood man
         (as distinguished from woodman).
