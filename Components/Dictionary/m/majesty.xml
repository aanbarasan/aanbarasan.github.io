      <WordDefinition>Majesty \Maj"es*ty\, n.; pl. {Majesties}. [OE. magestee, F.
   majest['e], L. majestas, fr. an old compar. of magnus great.
   See {Major}, {Master}.]
   The dignity and authority of sovereign power; quality or
   state which inspires awe or reverence; grandeur; exalted
   dignity, whether proceeding from rank, character, or bearing;
   imposing loftiness; stateliness; -- usually applied to the
   rank and dignity of sovereigns.

                                                  xciii. 1.
   [1913 Webster]

         No sovereign has ever represented the majesty of a
         great state with more dignity and grace. --Macaulay.

   2. Hence, used with the possessive pronoun, the title of an
      emperor, king or queen; -- in this sense taking a plural;

            In all the public writs which he [Emperor Charles
            V.] now issued as King of Spain, he assumed the
            title of Majesty, and required it from his subjects
            as a mark of respect. Before that time all the
            monarchs of Europe were satisfied with the
            appellation of Highness or Grace.     --Robertson.

      the ceremonies and discipline of the church in the second
      and third centuries.

   {Apostolic church}, the Christian church; -- so called on
